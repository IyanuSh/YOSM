A steamy soap opera unfolding against the backdrop of a cautionary history lesson reminding us that in Nigeria, the more things change, the more they stay insane.	positive
An enormous amount of work and scrutiny went into making this. Such an enormous amount, its quality stands out easily and brazenly. The sheer amount of authenticity is simply breathtaking.	positive
My Village People is a movie that will have you losing your home training while watching it. But it is a pathfinder of sorts. Nollywood generally has not done a good job of making the supernatural sexy and appealing. My Village People achieves it effortlessly, and deserves copious amount of praise.	positive
The story is nothing we haven't seen before but its told from a Nigerian perspective, its funny, quirky and the dialogue is great when compared with others available in the Nigerian market.  I totally enjoyed the movie, would definitely recommend (to my Naija folks!).	positive
1980's, drug mules, beautiful black women ... I'm in heaven	positive
Realistic but slow pacing and very melodramatic.  Good acting, based on true events and a decent story. The pacing was a little too slow for my liking and some scenes feel like a made-for-tv movie (the cheese music and the over dramatization).  Overall watchable if you know what you are getting into ahead of time.	positive
Correction.  Thanks for this. I am impressed with it. But I Nelson Orah played the character of Ahmed, not Umar. I will appreciate it if it is corrected.	positive
She is' Super Fantastic! You want to see this movie. This movie is extraordinarily enjoyable. Pure Nollywood sweetness.	positive
I was thrilled after watching the movie, everything was on point. I was particularly impressed with the quality of the cast and crew. The director, Kemi Adetiba did a great job and I'm so proud of her. I have recommended it to so many people. I look forward to watching more of her work.	positive
Genevieve Nnaji stamps her foot concretely in the pantheon of genuis directors. She doesn't disappoint in her debut, Lion Heart. It's a must watch, as it announces the birth of an international Nollywood.	positive
Nollywood at its peak!!!!  This movie tells a story about culture, unity and family. So many themes that I can't finish mentioning.	positive
A Good and Wise film. It was a good film, that shows the dangers of Nigerian tribalism and how it can affect a young love.	positive
this movie is a good offering in the genre.	positive
Loved this Movie  I was really surprised to read negative reviews for this movie. Do we truly know what a good movie is? This movie was really good, very enjoyable. Well developed characters, believable and relatable story line. And the quality, fantastic. Well done guys. Loved it even more than wedding party 1 and 2. I am not disappointed at all.	positive
Saw the PremiereÃÅ in Houston Texas  This movie should win an Oscar Award. The Storyline is so good. The Actors wereÃÅ all incredible.	positive
Anyone who loves art, Who's seen part one will know the plot and storyline was already built dEreÃÅ and this was a follow up.	positive
Great outcome.	positive
Expository Movie  This is a very good and distinct movie. Some people might not like it perhaps because they are used to the love or thriller story films or perhaps because they are not used to life with a vehicle. They movie truly shows how things really are in the life of mechanics, apprentices and customers. It also teachers parents and children a good lesson. It is a seemingly perfect expository movie.	positive
Understated, powerful crime drama with historical flavor This was a very character rich film. Not a single scene was wasted.	positive
Great continuity throughout the movie... The writer and director is highly intelligent and creative. Thank you so much for this amazing movie	positive
I enjoyed seeing very good parts of Lagos, both on the mainland and the island, used, unlike other movies that stay in one location. Lagos is a beautiful place to shoot a movie, especially if the diversity of the state is put to use, as seen here. Accident scenes are usually tricky for Nollywood to portray, but it was a pleasant surprise to see a very believable one here.	positive
Citation the movie Perfect Movie. Loved every second of the movie. Wished it didn't end	positive
Akinnuoye-Agbaje's directorial debut is a troubling coming-of-age story based upon the directors own experiences as a 'farmed out' Nigerian child in the UK during a period of surging xenophobia in the wake of the Windrush generations arrival. The look and feel of the films early moments present a setting and characters so raw and realistic that one could only capture from having experienced them. The pacing of the film in many ways reflects this. At times seeming to take on an almost frantic pace which is meaningful in a way that captures the effect of somebody recalling their life story - made up of the important details and traumatic moments - though occasionally making it difficult to capture and appreciate the passage of time bordering on surreal. The supporting characters similarly are raw and identifiable foils though lacking in the depth required to be whole characters beyond their interactions with the film's lead. Furthermore the film does little to address or contextualize its setting, deliberately choosing to focus on the internal struggles of it's central character. Despite this the films central character is compelling enough to keep the viewer engaged solely in his development throughout the film. Overall Farming is an impressive directorial debut that tackles issues of dual identity and self-hatred in a manner that leaves plenty unsaid but provides a bitter and frequently heartbreaking account of an individuals struggle for meaning and identity. There is so much to be admired about this film which presents an often overlooked period in British history, the importance of such a personal topic deserving of a greater run-time than the films mere 107 minutes.	positive
amazing film must see	positive
Good series I really like this show. All the characters are great and I enjoy watching. Hope it stay around for more seasons. Looking forward to the next season!!!	positive
Working from a script by playwright Darci Picoult, Dosunmu fashions a tale that‚Äôs realistic, melodramatic and culturally specific (we spend as much time ogling colorfully patterned dresses as we do admiring Gurira‚Äôs endlessly expressive face), yet unmistakably archetypal.	positive
Great movie!	positive
No words to describe the power of this movie and its reminder of how fortunate it is to have never lived through a civil war. Extraordinary story telling of tragic, recent Nigerian history and the humanity within it all.	positive
Beautiful	positive
Rational representation of the Igbos  Lion heart represented what it really means to be Igbo - hard-working and communal system of living.	positive
There is a lot of mediocre acting here and there and some things made little to no sense for me but overall i did enjoy it for what it is. I would probably not watch it ever again but seeing it once is nice.	positive
While the themes here are, of course, redolent of neorealism, the filmmakers don‚Äôt make ostentatious nods to cinema past. Their voice is their own; the camera is mobile when it needs to be, but stands still much of the time, letting the excellent cast build their characters as the events of the film test their endurance.	positive
Funny Funny Funny  Oh mehn, this movie is super funny. if you are looking for a movie to lift your mood up then this is the right movie for you.	positive
Superb movie!! This has got to be the best made movie to come out of Nigeria, not to mention hilariously funny!	positive
BEAUTIFUL AFRICAN WOMEN	positive
I don't know on what basis people have given this movie such a low rating but believe me after a long time I've a watched such a good, cute, clean and better than Bollywood movie.	positive
The picture quality of this movie is great, and the director did a good job.	positive
Outstanding performance  Temi Otedola's performance was truly stunning. I thoroughly enjoyed the layers that the story had and the way that each key piece of information was revealed.	positive
A Major Step in taking back our narrative  This movie, has really showed a deep side of the struggles of the people we often ignore. Easy to see a person to judge, but when stories like these are told you start to look at everyone with a different lens. The ending, though abrupt keeps you in a limbo and holds you in a powerful suspense pondering on what you just witnessed.	positive
Spot On!!! üî•üî•üî• Definitely African movie of the year, enjoyed every minute of the 2hours 30minutes üòÄüëèüëèüëèüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•‚úî‚úå	positive
A rare story about the values of family from a very distinctive perspective. Eloquently interpreted with perfect casting	positive
Finally a great Nigerian film. For years I‚Äôve been hoping that Nigeria would produce a really great film, and that‚Äôs where the Esiri brothers come in.	positive
Honestly this movie is really good production wise and the sequel. Chills from top notch acting.	positive
Hardly was there a period of 5 minute in this movie with nothing to smile, chuckle or laugh about. I don't think there is a Nigerian movie that beats this in it's genre (Fictional Comedy). The movie effects were as well commendable.	positive
Good Nollywood romantic comedy This movie is exactly cheesy enough to make you smile after a bad day.	positive
Nice cross-country movie  The only thing that I don't like about this movie is the way there was little or no interaction with the Nigerian or Indian environment.  Beautiful romantic movie.	positive
The story starts a bit slow but stick with it. Very good story.	positive
King of Boys  This series is absolutely fantastic, from the story line to the cast, costumes and the emotion portrayed by the protagonist. I'm sure proud to be a Nigerian at this time. Well done Kemi Adetiba, well done Sola Sobowale!	positive
A must see for everyone  Namaste wahala is a masterpiece and officially a cross between cultures. This Nollywood Bollywood collaboration have everything in a good romantic movie should have, the indian actors wereÃÅ all great and played their roles perfectly.	positive
Realistic, entertaining and all round good vibes. I could watch it all day. I wish they would air more than once a week though, asides from that, its just great. Most reality shows come off as scripted but not this one.	positive
On a Nollywood scale I'll give this movie an 9 because of it's unique storyline and excellent production which sets it aside from other Nigerian movies	positive
Good story line  It's a good movie and storyline. Loved it.	positive
Speechless;  This movie gave me goose bumps I connected in a way that literally tore my soul. Indeed depicted God the way and manner it should God bless the writer, producers and all involved. The actors too are top top everyone did a fantastic job.	positive
I enjoyed the relationship crafted between Mr. Tayo (Bimbo Manuel) and Ejiro (RMD),	positive
One thing I like about the movie is the way the story was told and the ways the actors interpreted it. The writers, directors and cinematographers deserve an applaud for this effort. 	positive
Best Christian Movie!!!  I love this movie! It's so well done - The acting was awesome and the storyline was refreshing. Kudos to the entire cast and crew! Definitely a must-watch!  P. S. You'll need tissues.	positive
Love it! I love the movie, the actors , the director etc. Everyone absolutely made it great with their acting skill  Anyone who finds it bad doesn't clearly know a good movie, and possibly can't relate with our cultures.	positive
Awesome  The movie was awesome with beautiful characters. I love seeing Bisola in movies, she's good.	positive
Beautiful acting, beautiful directing, not so great story I had to open an account just to review this movie. This is a beautiful work of art. 	positive
Interesting  I really enjoyed this movie. The acting and story line was really good. I found it to be very interesting to wonder about Ishi's life - this for sure is an eye opener to so many who are forced into marriage.	positive
Gabriel Afolayan is in a class of his own as an actor; he always understands the task.	positive
Not as Bad as reviewed.	positive
Great film and great action  Great story original great action and great comedy all combined in one. Thrilling film and great cast.	positive
A well-acted, finely wrought epic that nevertheless struggles to balance the requirements of melodrama with its drive to capture a historical moment.	positive
Awesome  The first time I saw this movie I was blown away. I don't want to sound crazy but I try to study things of this world. I hope to see a second installment with the same characters and a darker plot.	positive
Amazing I'd of normally flicked past this, but honestly it's an amazing story. You can tell it had a low budget, but the direction and screen play is fantastic! The choreography of the fight scenes lacked a little. Worth a watch definitely	positive
Engrossing tale of family and war  I recommend this movie without reservation.	positive
Wow  This movie really made me change my relationship for the best. Great movie. The movie did start off slow but it definitely kept me interested. The flash backs really made the ending even more intense because everything came together.	positive
People will never learn if they don't even try.  This movie tackles so many issues including the biggest one of all. Identity Crisis in Black men.	positive
Through an economy of exposition, Eyimofe, (translated as ‚ÄúThis is My Desire‚Äù) delivers a timeless, universal portrait of human resilience while establishing Arie and Chuko as a welcome new addition to the filmmaking brood.	positive
it is a great movie from someone whom we know to be a great storyteller. Gold Statue may not be one of Tade Ogidan‚Äôs best works, but it ranks high up there	positive
Nice movie  Great story line. It was worth watching. I certainly would recommend watching it.	positive
This was fun to watch  The Delivery Boy is very refreshing, a beautiful story, told brilliantly. You should see it!	positive
This show should have 5 seasons!!!!  This show was so interesting and entertaining. If the real Caliphate has a problem with it. Change or abbreviate the name, abeg. Great cast!!! Great writing!!! Great visuals. :)	positive
Great movie  I cannot for the life of me understand the low reviews for such a remarkable film. This series was so good that I binged the entire series as a Medical Student. Great work and thumbs up to the producer and casts.	positive
The production was great a d light years ahead of most of the sub-par movies of African cinema. This movie is truly a great step in the right direction for Afican cinema.	positive
Entertaining live concert featuring lively arrangements of jazz and pop standards and an excellent orchestra	positive
This return of the king is glorious.	positive
Great job!!	positive
Well crafted, highly personal story told with superb acting	positive
Still one of the Best Nigerian films of 2017 Isoken is a great film showcasing the culture of the area of the country. The layout, filming, colors and dressing tell much of the tradition quite well. The film has quite a good inject of laughter and great acting. 	positive
Great watch  Great movie! I enjoyed the fact that they promoted the Igbo language!	positive
"Hand-held camera chases, emotionally fraught close-ups, arresting compositions and a script that gives a familiar story a distinctly African flavor make ""√íl√≤t≈´r√©"" a thriller you not only endure but marvel over and embrace."	positive
You need to watch this!!!!!  A must watch!!! I'm in love with the character The plot Literally everything	positive
fantastic movie	positive
I love you - I have a baby‚Ä¶	positive
A great piece of work by Kemi Adetiba, the story was well scripted, good cinematography, all actors gave a great performance. This is a world class movie... Kudos to the all the crews	positive
Powerful film of a totally forgotten episode in history; not for the faint of heart.	positive
Great film - entertained and educated	positive
serious drama with subtle comedy, my type	positive
Wow, this true story! Wow! Amazing  Wow this story! The many many many stories of the Black experience throughout the African diaspora, and throughout generations. I am so glad our Brotha shared his story and got to write, direct, star in. And Damson wow, his acting is always amazing.	positive
Impressive & funny how they portrayed both cultures. I was entertained all through! Clean cut production.	positive
Excellent delivery  The movie is a wonderful delivery of the sexual assaults on university female student by some lecturer. It passes the message in a simple unsuspecting manner. Unpredictable end however, a few forgivable misses	positive
Amazing  Loved the display if pure culture even in the music. Great to see the people who made me watch nollywood movies again. All round thrilling and very funny..	positive
Fantastic Series from Nigeria  I love this series. Great scenery. Fantastic acting. Everybody was giving their A game. The jokes were natural and very relatable. It was educative as well.	positive
Hits the right note The language is Street, the cast stellar, cinematography and editing is on point. It also has a great plot. Best of all it puts Ajegunle on the map.	positive
New Pandemic that could happen again!  It's a a brilliant movie and very realistic about what really happened. It's better than the movie Contagion in my book. It really hit close to home for me. It's one of the first serious pandemic in my lifetime. I would really like to purchase this movie on DVD and I've been look in the US but to no avail. Can someone tell me how? Thanks	positive
How does a movie with this subject matter wind up being this slow and boring? Where is the urgency? Where is the suspense and tension? The editing and the pacing drove me nuts and there's just no way this thing needed to be nearly two and half hours long. And that's really a shame because it highlights a really big and important problem, I just wish it did so without putting the audience to sleep.	positive
Lionheart is such a beautiful movieüëè  This movie is the best Nollywood movie I've seen so far. Every scene was precise, beautiful and with a touch of humour and a moral lesson. I like that Nigeria was well represented.	positive
Season 2  I loved Season 1 and I could hardly wait for Season 2. I like all the characters. So hopefully you'll keep bringing on the new Series.	positive
"It was a 2hours movie that I rather shouldn't call entertainment but a moment of empowerment. If I was having doubts, my conviction got better... I was able to connect with the movie because obviously, I have experienced a touch of God before.  I say ""yes"" again to God's call."	positive
It almost accurately portrayed the abuses a lot female students face in Nigerian universities and west Africa at large	positive
Colorful and detailing but thrilling isn't the word  In general, Fifty is standard, beautiful and lively, it is expected to be thrilling at the end but the goose in my pimples didn't show off much but I was happy remembering few lines and scenes at the end.	positive
Kunle Afo's most impactful movie so far..  The movie address a topic that is very fundamental in Nigeria Education system. Good story line, interesting plot, fantastic acting. This movie is one of the best you will ever watch on topics bothering on gender based violence in Africans higher institutions. Just enjoy it and firm your unbiased review! It's a cool one	positive
A Brilliant Movie  Just watched Lara and the Beat on Netflix. This film is wonderful. Beautiful cinematography, on point acting, a great story, nice music and wholesome entertainment that the whole family can enjoy.	positive
Refreshing Loved everything about it. The culture, language and music were beautiful.	positive
The movie authentically gives us the feel of the eighties, up to how parties were organized, the talk about bleaching, the clothes, and the generous use of damask and adire.	positive
It's a well paced movie, filled with properly fleshed out characters operating in a plot structure that doesn't fall apart. The film. is brought o life with a stunning aesthetic and masterful cinematography. The story, although not phenomenal, is good enough to keep you glued to your seat while imparting a thing or two about the subject matter.	positive
"Season 2 Please!  I watched ""Fifty Series"" and came upon Castle & Castle because of Tola face was familiar. I love this series and would love for a season 2 to come! I just hate that if left me hanging on the last episode, like a season 2 would be coming. So please give us a season 2!!"	positive
Terrific film!  This is an intense, heartbreaking family drama with an excellent script and stellar acting performances.	positive
Light and funny! An absolute comedy gold with a great plot-line. From the sisters to the villains, this is a must watch! Not the mention the unexpected fantasy elements and great special effects! Highly recommended.	positive
They took a risk but the execution from production to acting was very well done.	positive
Farming may not be the best-executed story, but with a captivating performance by Damson Idris, nevertheless, it is still a story worth telling.	positive
SUPERBLY REFRESHING!!!  Everything about this movie was just on POINT! The story line, characters and directing..down to costumes. I absolutely enjoyed this!! My popcorn was out in minutes! Love love love! Please make more movies!!!	positive
Nice cross-country movie  The only thing that I don't like about this movie is the way there was little or no interaction with the Nigerian or Indian environment.  Beautiful romantic movie.	positive
Amazing movie  I loved loved watching this movie with its excellent plot, screenplay directing and Dakore and the cast delivered so well on the acting. Our culture and heritage was fully represented.Oscar worthy if it was in indigenous category. Definitely a 10/10 for me	positive
A fantastic movie!!! Wow wow wow. Nollywood has ascended.	positive
Brilliant  Good story line that requires so much attention. But overall, the movie is well done.	positive
Great Movie from Nollywood.  Lionheart wasn't just written for the sake of it. It portrayed so many things going on in Nigeria that it'll take one with in-depth and an open mind to see through the movie.	positive
This is by far the best production from nollywood! It looks more like an African American film. The acting is top notch and to find out it is the lead actresses first film, thumbs up.	positive
Something like a Shakespearean comedy, full of highly amusing, sharply drawn characters and offering wicked insight into how identity is shaped by city living and immigrant culture clash.	positive
Nigerians in Brooklyn  This is an amazing film, suspenseful, thoughtful, and colorful.	positive
Temi Otedola did amazing job!	positive
Thank you for a perfect example of how HE works in our lives: This movie is a gut-wrencher, reminding us how He works through imperfect, repentant people who are only called to obey Him. He does the rest. He is faithful to complete what He has started. What a GOD honoring movie, showing the Triune in goodness and glory and power. Thank you.	positive
Stroyline was beautiful  The plot twist was everything. Suspense filled. Gripping and interesting. Touched a lot on the importance of communication in relationships. I'll watch it over and over again.	positive
I love this film! I've watched it several times. I hope another one is in the works	positive
A Modern Nigerian Classic   Nollywood truly has a political/religious/tribal gem here for those who seek to broaden their perceptions of the whys of the major ills of the world & in this case a small community in Nigeria - r so pervasive today.  Soul comes to this physical reality for experiences & this film delivers a ton of them‚ù§	positive
Fun to watch especially if u understand the Igbo language... But in general it's a good and interesting movie..	positive
This movie feels like a mish mash of under-developed ideas with a half hearted romance thrown in. It is not sure if it wants to be a comedy or a satire.	positive
Genevieve Nnaji proves yet again while she's still the best Nollywood actress of all time with her directing debut. we can only say more grease	positive
A film which captured a nation's hope for better cinema  One can only wish that other Nigerian filmmakers will build on this same ground for a much brighter Nigerian film future.	positive
Absolutely sensational  This made me feel proud to be Nigerian. Storyline aside, the performances from each character wEreÃÅ phenomenal and really captured my attention.	positive
Searching for a soundtrack & review  There'se a soundtrack at the end of the movie. On the background. It contains no words, it's more a melody. I'm trying to find the name of it.  Beside that, great movie, really slow paced. Acting is realistic. No absurb emotions or anything like that. The conversations, the choosen words, the evens, the chemistry. It looks natural like you're watching a real situation. There's alot of silent moments and stuff like that. So you either like this type of movies, or you don't	positive
my number one nigeria sci fi best movie I love the movie, it falls into my favorite type which i am satisfy off, looking forward for nigeria to bring more to screen.  And my advice for us Nigerian is to support this movie to encourage them to bring and produce more better movies of our choice for us to watch.	positive
Kemi Adetiba's King of Boys is exceptional. From the selection of cast to the well executed story line, this movie is nothing short of excellent. The thrill, plot twists, humor, unpredictability are unmatched.	positive
Perfection  Someone should please help me find a mistake in this movie because I have watched it four times and still I can't find one. Everything about the movie was perfect. The movie is an original.	positive
This film is is a true story and is absolutely brilliant and moving.	positive
A Refreshing Nigerian Series  Such a refreshing Nigerian series to watch without the awful music playing throughout the movie. However. I don't like that Netflix just carried Season 1, got me piqued and their is no season 2 to be found.	positive
If it were food I would say mouth watering  The film citation is a necessity, I do not see where it would ever run out of relevance. The actors were carefully picked and displayed such professionalism, the location were amazing never new had such good universities in Senegal , the arts and craft of our African leaders carved out the African identity.  The message this movie carries, how it was told is so special, insightful and artistic. The suspense is on another level, the melange of feelings it creates to us the viewers is something else.  Citation is a must watch go watch it on NETFLIX	positive
Excellent Film  This was a great film. A very simple storyline that provides a glimpse into the past to two boys (with many unknowns).. then the twists and turns that surround their reunion as grown men.  Well done! So different from anything I've ever scene.	positive
Loved it  ... beautiful movie ... i love my Nigerians. Beautiful storyline too . Well done	positive
Beautiful, beautiful, sad and necessary.	positive
My Village People delivered fantastic special effects, and they are not over the top. One of my favourite special effects is the rain. The technical crew deserves special recognition for their skills in this movie	positive
Historic, Thrilling, Educative and Awesome	positive
This is my favourite Nigerian film. Really enthralling debut feature.	positive
I deeply appreciated seeing a movie with an emotional bond between two sisters who were connected in so many ways, but disconnected by romance and political views. The movie actors were superb and each character was perfectly cast for their roles.	positive
An Educational But Visceral & harrowing Film Expertly Crafted It's A great movie well acted and Directed Expertly Crafted while Being educational to a degree but it's a fully immersive visceral experience .  Exploring Race ,and Gang Culture ,in England it's hard to believe some of these things Knowing that it was based on true story makes it and even tougher pill to swallow .Maybe a few scenes are for theatrical licence but still it comes from some where real .  There's so many point in the film where i'd just ask why ? why would you do that ! Nooo !  it's not for the faint hearted and it kind of messes with your mind it's the kind of movie that will leave you with many questions  entertaining but thought provoking and intriguing A work of art One of the Most Original Movies I've seen in ages a refreshing perspective Definitely worth a watch	positive
It was a nice, wholesome movie about Love, Faith, Family and temptations of the world.......was a bit cheesy, but I enjoyed it. Fell in love with Mawuli Gavor and would watch it again just to see him..	positive
Beautiful movie depicting historic events in Benin kingdom  This movie was very educational and intereÃÅsting to watch. I am still in shock it was done in 2014. The acting and directing was superb Kudos to the cast and crew.	positive
Great concept  Creative storyline with talented actors. A bit excessive with some of the flashbacks but still very interesting throughout.	positive
Authentic!  This movie had so many parts that were real!  People do borrow clothes and cars and pose with them, lie through their teeth to drum up business and people do learn from their mistakes and extend a helping hand.  It was a great comedy with some good lessons including- don't believe the glitter!	positive
These people deserve a whole fucking lot of credit for this movie. The writing is eh. Performances are eh. But so, so hard, and they did it. You have to appreciate that. Also, this is not the Nigerian movie. This is a one-shot rom-com about twenty-something white people.	positive
Do-mi-til-la!  Domitilla is a landmark film in the Nigerian home video industry	positive
Amazing! The Director and the producers did amazing work on this movie.	positive
An Intelligent Film  This is a Film that gives an introspect into the degradation of surrealism and spiritual elements in the African society due to environmental pollution. This goes to show how the physical greatly affects the spiritual and vice versa. This is a really good movie to see.	positive
Heartwarming, good natured film  Appreciated the message about the universality of love and the way the film goes on to show the value of the protagonist in a professional, moral capacity as well as a her beauty.	positive
Simply the best so far Not surprise that it is Kemi Adetiba on this one but everything about the film is the best of its kind so far in Nollywood. Of course there enough room for improvement. Cinematography was top notch but most impressive is the interpretation of the story.	positive
Great movie  In terms of acting, this is one of the greatest movie I have watched. It took me back to the days of classical Nigerian movies wEreÃÅ the acting was so pure and detailed. The storyline is immersive, and intriguing. Great movie.	positive
"Two Thumbs Up. ""Isoken meets Something New"""	positive
The best of the movie finds a way to abridge the novel and still allow the scenes to breathe.	positive
I enjoyed the movie, and its overall message, that was frankly superimposed at all times. but the movie had a positive and optimistic message, so i found story development and everything to be appropriate.	positive
A story told like no other It's a quality movie, watch it with an open mind.	positive
Wow! Netflix finally picked up something good.	positive
Gem of a documentary, educational, hilarious, heartfelt, basically an emotional rollercoaster.	positive
The movie is well paced and has good, short scenes that pass across the message succinctly.	positive
It's a really nice movie..	positive
Level Up!  Nollywood movies are getting up where we want it. I loved the acting, storyline & casting line-up of this movie. Its a good romcom in a Naija way!  Nice acting y' all.	positive
"flawed but enjoyable (and important)  A faithful adaptation of one of the novels that began modern Hausa literature in the colonial period, by the future Prime Minister of Nigeria, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. The acting is a bit stilted at times, and the director betrays his training in documentaries. But Hausa (or ""Haoussa"" as they spell it in most of the French speaking countries) is the largest language in Africa south of the Sahara, and if you are at all curious to see a Hausa movie, or real African film, this is one to see.  When I saw it in the States with a friend we watched a long dialogue at the beginning, followed by subtitles which translated the exchange with two words: ""Hello."" and ""Hello.""  My friend leaned over and whispered ""What did they say?""  ""That was it."" I explained ""That was 'hello' in Hausa.""  It may not always make sense to you, but to the Hausa this movie was a hit, and remains a classic, ""must see"" Hausa film."	positive
Cute and romantic movie  I love the characters and how they unfold. Really sweet and relaxing movie. Think Love Jones.	positive
The character is bold and over the top as she should be, but Ms. Adetiba knows how to operate with directorial constraint. Kudos! I will recommend it highly to all whom I know.	positive
An amazing piece of work  Truly, I went into the movie not really expecting much but I was pleasantly surprise. There are some scenes i am yet to recover from. Beautiful piece of work, stuff that classics are made of. I am really going to see it again!	positive
A Simple Story But Well Executed I would recommend the movie. It was solidly good and well worth watching	positive
Nice cross-country movie  The only thing that I don't like about this movie is the way there was little or no interaction with the Nigerian or Indian environment.  Beautiful romantic movie.	positive
Amusing and uplifting, without ever being sentimental, Nnaji clearly has a bright future in the director's chair.	positive
A must watch  A cute movie,seye had qualities of what any woman will want...and if you want to watch something with the girl's I'll recommend this one.a decent movie that one can watch with they family.	positive
All I can say is that this movie is my movie of the year!	positive
This movie is the bomb.	positive
Amazing movie  This movie captured the troubles faced by the average Gen Z Nigerian kid. It did not gloss over anything. It left you sad and annoyed at some places. It left you triggered which I think was the point. To force the viewer to live the reality of the characters. I'm happy this story got told.	positive
Amazing and Crazy Hilarious This is the most hilarious movie I have come across this year.  The acting, story, cinematography and directing are all on point. Super impressed.	positive
Fantastic lead acting. Left emotionally devastated. Story is powerful.	positive
Arie and Chuko Esiri‚Äôs film is understated in its attunement to the challenges of trying to escape a stagnant existence	positive
One of the best nollywood movie  I really enjoyed the movie, i now know why it's is considered as the first ground breaking nollywood movie	positive
This Is The Best Political Series In Africa  Let me start by saying kudos to every new members that made this outstanding political series possible	positive
Feel good movie Subtitles needed to get the finer details of the plot, but wonderful characters and a credit to another side of Nigeria never shown.	positive
Fun to watch  Enjoyed watching this movie. Love the perspective of the writer and the visuals. Appreciate that it wasn't the typical Nollywood movie.	positive
Nice movie for the holidays  A funny, spirited comedy that is thoroughly enjoyable to watch. Good acting, great use of settings, brings out the various dynamics of Nigerian family, friends, societal struggles and quests for love and money.	positive
It‚Äôs a powerfully sensual movie, gorgeously lensed colors and textures conveying its characters emotional states while thoughtfully exploring the range of human sexuality through Adenike‚Äôs experience.	positive
This was Surprisingly interesting. True story movies are almost always good.	positive
"Such a wonderful movie! From beginning to end it has you laughing, smiling, and crying. It really goes to show God's love and power even in our darkest and ""Last Days."" Many kudos to the cast (and producers) for a heart tugging film, their pain, suffering, love and triumphs were heartfelt throughout"	positive
So relatable for Africans in the diaspora  Spoke to my own experience if being a African not living in Africa and trying so  to find belonging in a new home. Fantastic film!   	positive
Very great movie.....it stimulates thoughts. There shouldn't be racial discrimination.	positive
Love it!!!  Every movie from Kunle Afolayan is always a story we can all generally relate with. The storyline, natural acting , great casting is always something to watch out for. Citation has got a good story line with it's plots and twists describing natural causes in our lives. I would say, this is another amazing movie to watch.	positive
One of the best nollywood movie  I really enjoyed the movie, i now know why it's is considered as the first ground breaking nollywood movie	positive
Actually Amazing It has everything. Binge watched the entire season. Brilliant cast and has useful legal information for their target audience. Educational, suspense filled, funny and relatable characters. What more can you ask for? It literally ticks al the boxes.	positive
Oh what a lovely film! As romance and history, this is by turns funny and tragic, suspenseful and celebratory, and never less than solidly entertaining.	positive
I  thought the movie was well done. It's subject matter however is deadly serious. Kudos to the dedicated men and women of Lagos	positive
Farming is a excellent film but my god is it a tough watch  This was by far one of the best movies I have seen this year. I do not know why the rating is so bad. This movie is by far better than some of the movies that have received Oscars including Moonlight.  Farming is an extremely tough movie to watch. Every scene comes down on you... Hard enough to either make you cry out in pain, anger or just good old plain frustration. I couldn't stop cursing!	positive
OMG How did I miss this show  I am so wrapped up in this series. Love every comedy line..Stella that's my girl right there...phenomenal actress.	positive
A decent movie's chance taken away from destructive criticism.	positive
This was one hell of a ride  I recommend this movie to anyone interested into this topic - or anyone who enjoy great movies! Go watch this movie, and hit like NOW!	positive
Amazing Movie!  Enjoyed watching the entire time! Great Storyline.	positive
God called me....... As He is my witness, I was guided to view this awesome movie yesterday. Even though I was looking for a movie for distraction, I was compelled to watch this extraordinarily crafted movie yesterday. It fell in line perfectly with the personal spiritual search I've been on lately. During the time I watched, answer after answer to so many questions came to me. I'm still astounded.  Watch this, please, with an open mind.	positive
A film set in Africa about Africans - a nice change.  It was refreshing to see a film set in Africa which was about the African people of today rather than the great white hunter and the colonial era	positive
Amazing Acting and Production  Best out of Nollywood. Loved it. The acting the storyline.	positive
The best movie ever	positive
AN EXCELLENT SERIES!!  This series had me just HOOKED within the first 20 mins. of the show! I just loved everything about it from beginning to end. Especially, the REAL-LIFE examples/reason the people needed lawyers. And, OMG! The laughter throughout this serious is non-stop.. I just hated for Season 1 to end.	positive
The 7 episode show went through the backstory of the African people and it really delves into the stories no one hears about and the unsung heroes that lead the Nigerian people to finding their independence.	positive
I'm blown...and still reeling from the story and production.	positive
Saw lion heart on the 24th of December, and also went to see it on the 31st of December, yes it's that good! Everyone gave it a standing ovation!	positive
Pleasant Surprise! Great Acting!!	positive
A must watch Beautiful romance movie. 	positive
Every scene carried the viewer along seamlessly. As one who does understand any language besides English,I highly recommend this movie and best of all its a movie you can watch again and again.	positive
Better than expected	positive
This story was a beautiful picture of the balance of joy and sorrow during the time of the Nigerian Civil War. I loved it and I would recommend it.	positive
Guess this may be the apex of nollywood cinema in many ways but as a beginner viewer it‚Äôs enjoyable nonetheless. Captured the chaotic nature and length of nollywood films with a novel storyline and a characteristic touch of Nigerian political culture	positive
A concrete jungle, criss-crossed by the endless mesh of electrical wiring - Lagos is brought to life.	positive
Living in Bondage the film that marked the start of Nollywood. I walked out of the theater strong in faith. And faith in Nigeria is what I have now.	positive
Beautiful movie  It was an all round entertainer. Good job	positive
Captivating  Zainab was captivating in her role as Sylvia. It left me hoping for a sequel. Throughout the twist and turns of the movie I could not help but be glued to the tv. I found myself pulling for Sylvia. Her seductiveness and witty demeanor was only surpassed by her outstanding acting skills.	positive
A fun-filled rollercoaster of emotions  If you're an open-minded, hopeless romantic, you'll definitely enjoy watching this movie. I thought that the lead characters had great chemistry and the supporting cast delivered fine performances as well. It was interesting to see the clash of cultures exposed and finally resolved amicably. There's plenty of humour, drama and tense moments to hold your interest. Certainly makes my favourite list.	positive
"""Narradores de Jav√©"" is a funny and dramatic simple story supported by a good and original screenplay, great direction and excellent performances of the cast formed by actors, actresses and amateurish simple persons."	positive
I'd say: worth watching!  Well made, well played, good actors, even though it might seem a bit slow at times (and over 2 hrs altogether), I still think it is worth watching anytime. Of course, it is not the brightest and happiest movie to watch during these corona and pandemic times...  but I liked it.	positive
I appreciate this movie and even more, I appreciate all the doctors and nurses in the world for their noble and humble work ethics, risking their lives to save ours.	positive
Lara and the Beats was the authenic soul nurturing plate of REAL Jollof with plantains, smiles, and love. Hopefully now it will become viral on the small screen, and get all of the accolates it deserves. A must see multiple times.	positive
A Brilliant Series From Nigeria!!! I am so happy I came across this series. I enjoyed it thoroughly from the beginning to the end. I hope thEreÃÅ will be a season two.	positive
Hilarious & light hearted  Chief Daddy is the type of movie you can watch over and over. The actors are fantastic, and the movie overall is a not-so-serious narration with valuable teachable moments. Sure there are a few plot holes that could have been handled better, but overall I would recommend.	positive
Originally Unoriginal  The story has a lovely premise. I love this movie, but as an ardent observer of Western cinema, it feels like a copy.	positive
Very good, if not wholly fulfilling.	positive
It was beautifully directed. Nollywood is coming upüî•big time. The real definition of a set up, with mind blowing twist and turns.	positive
"Sadly accurate, disturbing but incredibly engaging.  I grew up during this time period and sadly resonate with some of the issues which were brought up in this film. I have a close friend who also experienced ""farming"" and it still has repercussions in her and her family's life today. The film was sadly disturbing, but unfortunately accurate in a number of it's depictions of the era in the UK. I was shocked at the final revelation as to who Enitan is in real life, which definitely - as already explained by another reviewer - enhanced the emotional climax.  Excellent, albeit sad, but well worth watching if only for the historical context."	positive
A true story of Human trafficking. This is told just as it is. Wow. Why is this movie rated 5? It's a 10/10. This is excellent. Oluture is just perfect. Terrific! Awesome	positive
Scattershot but still packing some impacts	positive
Great movie. Enjoyed every seconds of it An interesting story line and a big kudos to all the cast and crew of king of boys, thank you for this awesome movie.	positive
He said, she said	positive
Remarkable  Citation is a blend of artistry work and talented personas	positive
Every single character in the movie did an excellent job.	positive
Accurate This movie talks about Nigeria and her politicians or politheivecians as I call them. Who are all jokers and comedians in a different area of life who decided to go into politics and toil with people's lives as much as they want entertain you on campaigns and forget what they were elected for. Big ups to the producers, actors and actresses, directors and the rest of the crew, nice movie budget especially when comparing it in the nollywood. Everything was nice but we would have loved if the movie was concluded in a way it should have been and not in suspense or another part or sequel to be released later on. Good movie especially if you are Nigerian and not interested in party or favouritism from the leaders. Just shows you the people we elect as leaders in this country are comedians who lack idea on how to rule a country. Once again big ups to everyone.	positive
I really enjoyed watching the movie. First time seeing Nollywood do something that can compete internationally.	positive
Brilliant movie This is a brilliant export from Nollywood. I am amazed at the level of quality of this film. Nigerian cinema is truly growing. Good job and we need a sequel.	positive
Not your everyday dilemma, but as depicted in this lushly detailed and passionately performed melodrama, the mores and traditions of this sequestered, seldom depicted group take on a broader relevance.	positive
A perfect story!  Amazingly realistic. It depicts the life and story of young Nigerian men living in Lagos.	positive
Not my type of movie but my type of actors	positive
"Refreshing, New, Love Story!! This is one of the best love. funny, well acted stories I have seen for a while! I love the beautiful black actors, and enjoyed that it is just as good as the typical ""Hollywood"" made movies!!"	positive
The performances are so natural with this absolutely unobtrusive camera that speaks the language of the independent domestic drama - the parts of the story unfamiliar to me, I‚Äôm able to catch up with.	positive
Good movie, would love to see a continuation of this movie.	positive
excellent Performances~  Well done! The performances by the entire cast was good, especially the actress who plays the mother along with the male and female lead. Would definitely watch more stories like this.	positive
I really enjoyed watching the movie. First time seeing Nollywood do something that can compete internationally.	positive
"Jumbled' is highly entertaining and exceptionally enjoyable. You will hate the characters, then you will love them, then hate them and love them again. 'Jumbled' is that special type of movie Nigerians love to love. You know, the type where one minute, you are going- ""This guy is so stupid."" The next, you are like ""Awww"". And not too long after that, your ""Awww"" quickly turns to ""Hehn? My God!"" Fantastic movie. Not perfect. But fantastic all the same."	positive
I enjoyed this movie üé•! Great acting and a different twist ending!üëç	positive
Nollywood blockbuster that turns out to be a sprawling, at times gloriously chaotic gangster epic about a woman who made it and who now rules the world by way of her facial expressions. So much energy.	positive
This movie will englighten you  As a Nigerian I know we have three major tribes: Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. However, you don't hear the mention of Hausa in places like America. Hausa's are termed the poorest-illiterates in the country. You hardly see or hear them in entertainment so the world isn't aware they even exist. I wish they will make more movies like this. The Hausa tribe needs to be heard!	positive
Loved this movie- the cinematography, the shots, the fashion and music was on point. Lagos looks sooooo good. The acting was very believable and I enjoyed humor in unexpected scenes like well- find out for yourself.	positive
We need season 2!!!  I binge watched season one. It was awesome.	positive
This was a good write, a good direct, a great watch, marvellous delivery, an elegant cast, a tasty plot!!!	positive
Under Rated  Good cast, good storyline. It's as real as things seem in Africa. Good watch	positive
Absolutely Stunning Picture  Overall I loved the movie in it's entirety and hope more directors and producers can provide more movies reading between the lines of historic events.	positive
Loved It All! Awesome Actresses! Entertaining Fashionable & Educational!!! These writers and directors were so on point. This series had me begging for more. I'm a major fan of these women and men now. More, Please!	positive
"Very well written & performed.  This was quite an original take on the common subject of infidelity. The plot was very well thought out; interesting and the pacing kept me engaged from the very beginning. It would throw me off from any predictability in fairly creative ways at well spaced out intervals throughout its nice length and the acting was of a decent standard from everyone too. The ending sealed this movie off really nicely and the moral lessons are sound.  On another note, I am so impressed by Nollywood movies nowadays. The storytelling and themes in general are leading the way for ""black movies"" because they have simply advanced way past the obvious notion that the cast or setting is black-orientated and instead they just focus more on everyday life without those patronising caricatures. So refreshing!  Quick note the editor: Less warp stabiliser."	positive
...contains memorable scenes and definitely, er, packs a punch, but it is marred by gauche directorial touches‚Ä¶	positive
Amazing movie  It was a wow movie, from the cast to the storyline.. it was flowing, it gave all the emotions high and low.. such a beautifully written movie. Worth every cent..	positive
The chemistry between Efa Iwara and Bisola Ayeola is so lovely, and when Efa switches to his comedic role is actually hilarious.	positive
its a good movie, see it.	positive
Best Nigerian Film Ever  LionHeart works so well as Comedy/Drama without even trying.. The humour flows naturally and it showcases the Nigerian culture and values in the most beautiful ways. The picture is absolutely beautiful but the performances are even better. Great job Genevieve Nnaji. Thank you for making us proud.	positive
The most underrated and underappreciated work of art in human history.	positive
Set against the backdrop of the 1976 coup attempt in Nigeria this is a good movie. Not much shoot em up but good drama.	positive
A huge progress for Nollywood movies I really enjoyed this movie, the truth behind it, the thrilling plot. Really outstanding work!	positive
Great movie but weak ending  The movie was great until the last 20 minutes, it's just went armateur. Was strong until they had to fill in too much details just before the end and then not even end the story.	positive
A must watch  The movie was amazing, its a must watch. If you want to pass time quickly watch this. I love the taxi scene, it is my favourite.	positive
The locations are perfect for the movie, giving us such a rich viewing experience, moving us from the affluent neighbourhoods to the almost destitute areas where people have to work for daily wages.	positive
A new dawn in the Nigerian movie industry.  It's very different from the average Nollywood movie, very entertaining and keeps you glued to your seat for the entire duration.	positive
The result is a work in which style and story unite to create a singularly mesmerizing look at a culture within a culture.	positive
I started the movie expecting it to be interestingly amateurish as have been some movies I have seen from that part of the world. But as the movie progressed, I realized it did not suffer in production values at all; in fact, it was superior in some ways to anything I have seen coming out of the West lately.	positive
Loved it  It was funny and good acting. Very nice romantic comedy! It nice to see African movies and actors	positive
Great Piece  This is a well-crafted, mind blowing work. The fact that I couldn't guess or know how it was going to end, blew my mind. The suspense is top notch. No unnecessary clip to prolong the movie but straight to the point. This is changing the narrative of Nollywood movies. Cheers to the Writer and Director. Highly recommended.	positive
The post script scene will have you laughing out of the cinema hall, and you will find yourself breaking out in a grin each time you recall flashes of the movie.	positive
Nice Movie  Really had a good time watching, the cast and crew wereÃÅ excellent! Amazing storyline . Kudos to the actors, Directors and producer. Will definitely recommend.	positive
Great Movie about relationship with God  I totally enjoyed watching this movie, it stirred up something in my spirit to be persistent with my walk with God and was a reminder that He is my father I can always talk to anytime. There is room for improvement for a better execution.	positive
"""the greatest inspirational movie I have seen so far. impresively directed and excellent performances"""	positive
It is lovely to see Kolade handle the car so well.  Daddy Showkey is the don and major bad guy, and he wears the role well. His acting needs some work, but he did not disappoint.	positive
Quite interesting Well Its about a Chicago gang star and one ex army general in Nigeria in the reverse. But all that is now gone as we know more.	positive
Funny  Funny and good acting. A different cool vibes.  I like how the main character is put of the ordinary and how the women stand up to the men.	positive
The storyline is unpredictable, the acting of most of the characters are believable. The picture quality is amazing!	positive
Fast-paced, funny, and sweet, The Royal Hibiscus Hotel proves that playing within genre doesn't have to result in a mediocre film	positive
If you are looking for a tight plot, excellent acting, unusual reveals, and situational comedy, with a touch of home-grown romance, this is the movie for you.	positive
Juju stories is a three short stories in a 1 hr 20 mins movie. The first story 'Love Portion' is where the juice is, the second story is 'Yam' is a woeful failure and 'Suffer The Witch' is eerily good. It is a win, 2 out of 3 were good.	positive
Great movie  The movie makes you feel every emotion which is a great marker for a great movie. It made me laugh, cry and filled with suspense on what will happen next. The production of the movie is A1 and the cast did a great job in portraying their characters. I enjoyed every second of it.	positive
This story is no fiction. The doctor who saved her country (and probably the world) from a deadly outbreak of Ebola has died from it. This very moving movie retraces what happened in Lagos in July 2014 with force and simplicity. The actors are convincing, true... It's sad, obviously, but also enriching with hope.	positive
Under Rated  Good cast, good storyline. It's as real as things seem in Africa. Good watch	positive
A  must watch  I loved this film it was so funny & romantic Simply brilliant	positive
Funny Funny Funny  Oh mehn, this movie is super funny. if you are looking for a movie to lift your mood up then this is the right movie for you.	positive
The locations add to the appeal of the movie The Lady Called Life and makes the movie relatable. It is beautifully and artfully done, and leaves a good feeling.	positive
I've never been this proud of a Nigerian movie and the fact that I'm seeing it the second time with this much excitement üòÉThis movie is beautifulüëå Story was a true Nigerian story, told the Nigerian way.	positive
Good to see a Nollywood movie that unites tribes and promote gender equality in an interesting way.	positive
"Quality is the hallmark of this movie. 'Lionheart' screams ""Quality! Quality! Quality!"" The production is a hundred. Everything just shinny and crispy."	positive
Great storyline, excellent audio and video quality. Production was top notch! Great combination of actors	positive
Great movie  Upbeat with underlying messages on family, loyalty, hard work and female success.	positive
Great Film  I hesitated viewing the film before reading the novel. After seeing the film, I am more intrigued about the novel and the history behind it. This is a GREAT FILM, make no mistake about it.	positive
Amazing production, impressive quality  Once I started I couldn't stop, I even watched it over and I NEVER do that! Fantastic storyline, great characters and performances. The production is my highlight, you can tell the level of detail that was put into this brilliant movie. I'm very impressed! More please!	positive
pretty good movie, but it felt kinda long to me... but definately worth watching	positive
Great TV Show! Thoroughly enjoyed season 1, the storylines and plot are compelling and I like that how it also has a comedy side to it. Can't wait for season 2! Congrats to the cast!	positive
It is a well directed and produced movie with a very sensitive theme. The story is well told and brought to life with an amazing cast.	positive
A must watch for younger Nigerians and general lovers of a good film. I will be looking out for more work by Kunle Afolayan. Well done!!!	positive
The drama is fast-paced and well apportioned; the comedy is natural and connects well with the viewers.	positive
Breath of fresh air!  FINALLY - a movie shot in Nigeria with international standards. Effortlessly funny and cunning, superior direction and cinematography. Eclectic, intentionally entertaining and attention gripping. Perfect blend of wit and humor depicted through deliberately complex yet simple visuals. Left me with the happy fuzzys.	positive
I love King of Boys Kemi Adetiba is a Brilliant Producer. King of Boys is a must watch. I love the drama and suspense.	positive
5-star movie alert!  Citation is a must watch for everyone, it embodies a part of the rich African culture, an amazing love story, overall the movie is fantastic.	positive
Beautiful production but a weak storyline  The acting was superb. Charley Boy is a delight to watch on camera. This was a wonderful effort by Kemi Adetiba and I'm really happy I got a chance to watch this.	positive
pretty good  It felt semi messy at times and was very overdramatized but I really enjoyed watching it anyway	positive
Amazing work of art!  Doctor Lanre will leave you glued to your seat all through. Great story, amazing cast, fantastic rendition of lines and suspense filled. The story is so unique, a diversion from the regular Nollywood love story.	positive
Outstanding Good acting performance to all the characters. Great videography. Truly epic & relatable to the street life of many. Perfect!!	positive
It is the kind of distinctive, culture-driven drama from emerging filmmakers that I wish we saw more of.	positive
Amazing show  This show is super amazing. It has 13 episodes and i was able to finish all episodes in 2 days.  Can't wait to see Season 2.  Everyone did very well, it is hard to pick my favorite.	positive
I saw this film in the FIFF (festival de films internationnal de Fribourg, in Swiss). This story is beautiful, and Adewale Akinnuoye Agbaje is incredible. If you can see the movie, you must go, you wont be sad !	positive
I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Beautifully shot and delightfully funny.	positive
Very Touching, Very good, Very recommended	positive
If you enjoyed the Godfather then you'll enjoy this. The storyline was beautiful and the plot twist at the end was incredible but there was some very unrealistic scenes that prove to be plot holes. But all in all the plot is very solid.	positive
Amazing Film  Indeed the most anticipated film from Nollywood 2019 didn't disappoint. Loved it all. Well done to Genevieve and Team	positive
The plot twist is different. Kudos  I'm a fan of Nigerian films. This one is different. The plot twist is different that I couldn't predict nor see anything coming. Kudos to the writer Ifeanyi Opara. The actors were super too. Characters were well interpreted	positive
Dope movie The cast selection was perfect, costumes on point and made a good villain üëè	positive
"""Narradores de Jav√©"" is a funny and dramatic simple story supported by a good and original screenplay, great direction and excellent performances of the cast formed by actors, actresses and amateurish simple persons."	positive
Adewale Akinnuoye Agbaje and his life story touched my heart.  Totally underrated.  It's very well directed, and very emotional.  I recommend this movie to everyone who likes biographical movies and real life stories.	positive
This world is ravishingly beautiful, but there‚Äôs also something oppressive about its exoticism. The color doesn‚Äôt just saturate the frame; it thickens it.	positive
This epic approach to a terrible conflict incorporates newsreels and maps to make things clearer for the uninitiated. It's an impressive film on many levels, and a significant achievement for the embryonic Nigerian film industry.	positive
This Lady Called Life is a gentle and sweet romantic comedy woven around the issues of childhood parental abuse and of generational curses.	positive
Beautiful, poetic, and hard-hitting without the use of excessive force and deeply layered with evolving and regional nuances of feminine experience	positive
A much needed mascarade  This is not just another naija silly film. It's still silly and Nigerian, but in a witty, essentially thought-provoking way. It's a statement. An indepth look into physical vs spiritual balance, which we're all seeking today. A fable with humble esthetics.	positive
Good watch Nigerian Nollywood movie is on the next level, nice storyline..	positive
nollywood going up YEsSIR. this is a new bar set dude and i love that its written and directed by a woman	positive
Absolutely Splendid diving into a decade long issue of harassment by Lecturers Please more of this meaningful content. Not movies focused on Lekki and oil money lifestyles. Yes some things might have been better but it gets a 10 from me because this is the type of content i love to see come out of nollywood.  Big respect to you Kunle.	positive
great cinematography. good editing. could do with a better story. writing was good also. overall good movie. great work by genevieve nnaji	positive
Very Different!  This is not your everyday movie. The star actors really deserve awards for their roles. I loved every minute of it. Please watch!	positive
Loved everybit of this movie  I have seen this movie 5 times already. i really like the movie	positive
Mind Blowing Piece Of Work.  Enjoyed it. Been a while I saw a movie so well acted and delivered. The theme was beautifully touched on. Well done Genevieve Nnaji and Team. Looking forward to your next reviews	positive
Isoken is so beautiful üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è Love the outfits The ending location was beautiful too, and I enjoyed the ending itself as well.  I was feeling down and this film lifted me up üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è	positive
Funny Christmas Comedy This movie had me cracking up from the start.	positive
Excellent and well portrayed series about the Nigerian Legal system  Very informative about the Nigerian Legal System. It also portrays the challenges in family business and the compromises that follow.	positive
Carries a rare sense of pensive cognizance and further provokes reflection on the part of its target audience.	positive
I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone interested in Nigerian history and heritage.	positive
Juju stories is a three short stories in a 1 hr 20 mins movie. The first story 'Love Portion' is where the juice is, the second story is 'Yam' is a woeful failure and 'Suffer The Witch' is eerily good. It is a win, 2 out of 3 were good.	positive
a week in the life of nigerians. good stuff.	positive
We were blessed to see 'Coming From Insanity' with a thirty something strong audience and we could literally feel their veins bursting with excitement as we were drawn closer and closer to the climax.	positive
Enjoyable This movie is enjoyable. Just keep an open mind, It is nice to see how upcoming actors and musicians can hold their own. I binge-watched it.	positive
Beautiful movie depicting historic events in Benin kingdom Kudos to the cast and crew.	positive
EXCELLENT film! The actors were great performers. The scenery and backdrops were well done. The soundtrack outstanding. The storyline is the bomb!	positive
Audiences will be pleasantly entertained with Nigerian director Kemi Adetiba's The Wedding Party, a charming, romantic comedy with a unique international flavor.	positive
lol dis movie is funny √∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???	positive
This movie is one that captured and then diminished my interest,but then captured it again.	positive
Uplifting, inspirational, beautiful movie.  My husband chose this movie and I didn't want to watch it. But I became totally sucked in and couldn't leave the room. The story of Sade is sad, but all that she goes through brings healing to her broken heart and changes her life in a meaningful and positive way. My husband and I both loved this movie!	positive
Interesting but...  It was too much melodramatic, but I enjoyed it. On the other hand this is a great tribute to all the medical staff who where at the epicenter of the crisis.	positive
Greetings, the movie the figurine reminds me a lesson from the English text book read during or probably school days, namely The Bottle Imp. The crux of the movie plot/story is identical equal to the bottle imp. Please no controversies, just my opinion, that is all.  Thanking you...	positive
This is an incredibly tasteful movie. Great acting by the leading lady.	positive
Kunle afolayan master piece	positive
The casting of KOB 2 gives the most appropriate roles to the people who would leave all on the screen, and they give stellar performances, including those who had non-speaking roles and cameo appearances. The acting is on point, so much that even facial expressions spoke volumes.	positive
Top notch All I have to say is that this movie was topnotch!!!! Kemi Adetiba you are the bossüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ	positive
Best of Nollywood  This is truly an exceptional film. the acting as beautiful and believable. Kudos to the team behind the film and Biola Alabi. Seyi Shay is a star abeg. And the camera WOW!!! Nollywood to the world!!!	positive
Citation: Kunle Afolayan's Deceptively Simple Yet Incredibly Complex Movie	positive
Excellent Storyline and Great Characters  Can't wait for Season 2!!! The show is well written, the characters are fully developed and the story lines are complex.	positive
Absolutely brilliant  Couldn't have been better really. I wondered what they would create after the initial movie but this limited series shows that a lot of work went into the production of this movie.	positive
Great work This was a good one, watched it once but it was totally worth it.	positive
The quality of the script cannot be faulted. It shows a well researched storyline that flows naturally and has no stilted parts. You would keep wondering, thinking you had solved the crime, only for you to later realise the script is several steps ahead of you. The movie is two and half hours in length, but there is no dull moment.	positive
Great film  I worked on this film. I don't normally watch films I've worked on but this was amazing top man ade John	positive
Don't listen to this negative feedback  I‚Äôve noticed some people can't handle the truth so they have to make up lies this is a great film not everything is true in the film but Adewale has said that but the old Tilbury skins are just jealous .... Take the film for what it is and understand life was bad in the 70s 80s for a lot of people enjoy the film and don't listen to this bad criticism.	positive
Was glued!!!!  I enjoyed it. It was brilliant coming from the stables of Hollywood movies. Not a wasted time spent	positive
It's good if you enjoy the subject  If this is a subject you like then it's a decent movie.  But it is extremely subdued and slow. The movie makes it worse and often is as loud as the speaking.	positive
Outstanding- sad, painful and jubilant	positive
This is a must see movie. I was very impressed!!!	positive
NOT A FAN OF NIGERIAN MOVIES, BUT THIS ONE PLEASES  The cast director selected wisely, the actors impressively reincarnate the true events back to life. Overall, its a cinematic masterpiece, hence the Netflix distribution.	positive
I'd say: worth watching!  Well made, well played, good actors, even though it might seem a bit slow at times (and over 2 hrs altogether), I still think it is worth watching anytime. Of course, it is not the brightest and happiest movie to watch during these corona and pandemic times...  but I liked it.	positive
I Enjoyed every bit of LionHeart. It warmed my heart watching Nollywood veterans bring the characters to life. Totally enjoyed Genevieve's acting.	positive
Powerful Movie asking and exposing the world medical system as satanic	positive
Absolutely Stunning Picture Incredible.  The lighting, cinematography, props are so beautiful, this movie can definitely be categorized as modern classic.	positive
My own understanding  The storyline is interesting and I loved everything about the movie üî•üî•	positive
Amazing  The storyline is quiet interesting, the actors are amazing and it wasn't as predictable as I thought it would.. Picture quality is awesome, Molly wood has really grown.	positive
A must watch!  From beginning to end, the hairs on the back of my neck couldn't stop standing. The story line was simple yet captivating, the acting was bang on and flawless.	positive
Well, the movie is good, I actually enjoyed it I got what I expected after seeing the end scene of Chief Daddy (the first movie) The actors did a good job with their roles, and yea the movie gat me laughing üòÇüòÇ It was hilarious.	positive
This movie is a beautiful representation of a modern life for a family faces with running a failing company in Nigeria, the camera play, acting and just overall environment of the movie exceeded its expectations.  LOVED IT	positive
Good African Soap Opera. Two Thumbs Up	positive
I thought it would be quite boring, however it was more engaging than I supposed, good characters, good acting, marathoning Nigerian movies and in love with them... , by the elite population, sad observation, apart from the patriarchal machismo, the scene of the wife humiliating herself to apologize, on her knees, was outrageous, although it has a comical character, veiled submission, or explicit...	positive
Beautifully written!  ThereÃÅ wereÃÅ no words minced and no truth, decorated falsely. This teaches a whole lot of message and exposure to the human trafficking world! Plus Sharon Ooja is such an exceptional actress.	positive
THE BEST MOVIE. EVER.  Things Fall Apart is the BEST movie ever. Even better than The Force Awakens. It should have won at least 5 Oscars. Okonkwo is the sexiest man I've ever seen, and everyone I've met who have seen him desire him.	positive
Great documentary  Spent the entire time looking at her beautiful skin( bev naya) and listening to the soothing soundtrack.	positive
Well written and superbly directed!  Nigeria is really peculiar, from the demographics and its diversity, Doctor Lanre touches every part our realities and everyday living. Doctor Lanre is a must watch!	positive
One of the best in African drama series  The talent, top notch , such quality acting from those ladies, hands down perfect.and the script was informative and well executed.  Keep it up Nollywood you're on the right track.	positive
Petition for a season 2!  I really really loved this and could totally relate, interesting from start to finish, kudos to cast and directors. Can there be a season and maybe better publicity?	positive
Loved the movie  It had a slow start but quickly picked up! A must watch!	positive
Powerful and deeply human film This is a very beautiful and thought-provoking movie which I can highly recommend to everyone.	positive
Great Movie  Kudos to the production team. Excellent Movie, The picture quality was Superb. Depiction of culture, through language, mannerisms etc was impeccable	positive
"""Narradores de Jav√©"", a generally hidden treasure even here in Brazil, is a very good Brazilian film with a simple, but good story."	positive
MY FAVORITE ROMCOM, YOU BITCHES COULD NEVER!!! and i was rooting for the white man... what about it? i can hate em and love em at the same time, the duality of man. thank you	positive
A great inspirational movie. A great family movie to watch with older kids.	positive
I loved this	positive
great movie, sending love from Naija	positive
Such wonderful writing  Doctor Lanre is a wonderful movie. Had so much fun watching this one. It captures the everyday life, demographic, region, it is diverse and a joy to watch.	positive
Brilliant film. a really good watch	positive
Amazing  This is a much watch movie , absolutely draws you in ,in this true story , please please watch this as you won't be disappointed	positive
Great ending. This movie kept me interested until the end, which is not easy to find in movies these days. A little predictable but still has suspense.	positive
Some very fine acting  With all the fake drama dominating Nollywood, which nothing says about the life of average Nigerian, Mokalik almost feels revolutionary. Values are the thread of an only apparently simple story. Really wish this movie may set a bew trend	positive
Want to watch again This is one of those Nigerian movies you watch over and over and over again. Great work all through.	positive
Overall, it's a fascinating slice of modern history that may be unfamiliar to some, which can also give us an insight into the making of contemporary Nigeria.	positive
Original  I am impressed. And I am rarely with 9ja movies/series. But am here at 1am watching this. It connects the dots. Kudos to the effort. Arese kudos.	positive
Not only does the plot fail to grip the viewer's attention, but the acting is the poorest, most unconvincing ever.	negative
This movie is long and dull. Even the background music is tepid. And there's nothing that can do to save the movie.	negative
A fine way to completely ruin your day	negative
unsettling	negative
The subjects in Swallow would make anyone cry -- poverty, sexual harassment, drug dealing, systemic corruption -- but the movie and all the characters are flat and emotionless.	negative
Though the central performance is impressively raw Farming's uncompromising bleakness drowns out the fascinating story, making it a far tougher watch than it needs to be.	negative
Story inconsistencies and the mystical balderdash were too appalling to be saved	negative
There wasn't a single person that wasn't insulting this as we trooped out. Even cinema staffers who didn't pay, were hissing. Horrible	negative
Equally powerful and uncomfortable, Farming is a stark reminder of the dangerous lengths that self-loathing can lead to.	negative
A terrible way to start the year; 'Akpe' is a mess.	negative
You might not hate yourself for seeing 'SuperStar' but you will leave feeling numb & comatose.	negative
It would definitely be unfair to the entire cast and crew if I left this one out. Totally unfair!	negative
Like other misguided projects like it, 'Knock Out Blessing' was made primarily for the purpose of massaging its producers' ego rather than pleasing its Nigerian audience.	negative
Akinnuoye-Agbaje's slightly numbed screenplay never gets to grips with who Eni is	negative
Fifty minutes is spent advertising a holiday resort in Lagos, Movie closes. Money down the drain. Not recommended	negative
Such a shame really; 'The Island' is a waste of amazing talent.	negative
if I said to you, that this was a spectacular movie, I would be telling a lie.	negative
Its lateness aside, the real problem with 'Funke' is that it is boring and unexciting.	negative
Not recommended! Crispy dry and terribly banal,	negative
Ultimately, this is a crappy offering that shouldn't have been brought to cinema.	negative
Production is fine, above average. Colour is sharp. And acting isn't horrific. The problem is the complete lack of intellectual strength in the story & the story-telling. A quick example will suffice:	negative
the amount of felonies this 6 year old committed over the course of this film became too many to count	negative
Suitable for 14 year olds Performed like a very clean Disney story. Limp and vacuous.	negative
There are some funny touches and moments of freewheeling energy, but it is too broad, with acting and directing styles that are a little like afternoon TV.	negative
Average The plot is just too short and predictable.	negative
But unfortunately, these shining moments were just to few and far between for them to justify paying serious money to see this	negative
moreover the drama between Joseph to his wife is played naturally but I feel like this is more documentry then a movie‚Ä¶	negative
Consequently, rhythms of long and short hisses echoed intermittently from the audience	negative
No one deserves to watch this shitty movie	negative
snooze fest, not much story, ridiculous soundtracks	negative
add horrible ADR, and average to really bad acting, and you have ‚Äî- a nightmare.	negative
It doesn't go wholly wrong all at once, but damned if the filmmakers don't lose the thread and stumble and lurch and pad this thing until their Nollywood film is Bollywood length, without the wit, warmth or content to justify it	negative
Grotesque and sub-standard. Boring and downright stupid!	negative
A flawed first feature film, but it shows a great deal of promise	negative
Concerning this popular movie #KOB I can't say it better or worst than the rest of nollyhood,	negative
Made in Heaven' is a stupid movie. It is so stupid, it will irritate you to the point you will start laughing out of sheer frustration. You will grow so weary seeing it, you will suddenly find yourself feeling as though you just might be enjoying the foolishness of this foolish movie. Very ridiculous movie. Complete rubbish!	negative
Slow moving, great acting and contains a few chills but the ending was unforgiving	negative
. In the absence of such a perfect storm, avoid stabbing your wallet in the heart with this 'Dagger'. Definitely not recommended	negative
When I say that the drive for comedy is turning our content to shit, this is a prime example.	negative
If  you watched Chief Daddy: Going For Broke on its New Year Day release on Netflix and immediately thought it to be a contender for the worst movie of the year, know that the fault isn't yours;	negative
Lazy and depressing!	negative
snooze fest, not much story, ridiculous soundtracks	negative
The movie wasn't great, a bit of overreaching of the actors (maybe over-directed?) but the context was great.	negative
Low quality for Such a High Budget	negative
A good plot. Terrible post-production.	negative
Not recommended.	negative
Great story, poor acting.	negative
A star studded movie that made stars look like they were acting a kindergarten play	negative
Not recommended.	negative
Preposterous! Horrendous! Disgraceful! A glowing shame.	negative
This movie's lineup makes me want to like it desperately, but it's difficult to relish amid the dim screenwriting by Genevieve Nnaji.	negative
By sure, one on the worst horror movies ever made...	negative
Talk about the acting though, the story script, it's something out of this world	negative
"Though falsely classified as ""Horror"", 'Bridal Shower' is in actual fact not a Horror-movie. It is a Stupid-movie- Completely and utterly stupid!"	negative
it is wholesomely pointless - A desperate money grab.	negative
Major Disappointment	negative
Boring	negative
Charming but incompetent	negative
Ruined by technical malfeasance, 'The Perfect Picture' proves to be miles away from being perfect.	negative
Slow moving predictability This film definitely belongs in the junior high circuit.	negative
but the sound and music was so bad that it destroyed anything good	negative
Did not watch all of this crap. Not even second rate, obviously racially inclined crap from an African nation with no film industry.	negative
Good storyline, poor execution	negative
The acting was bad, the soundtrack were repetitive, the storyline was... (if there was one I would have described it here).	negative
The plot it's good, but the technical aspects aren't that good at all.	negative
A clunky, clumsy handling of a book with (here untapped) depth	negative
There's nothing good about 'That Which Binds Us'. Absolutely nothing.	negative
Production of this movie is tight but the heart is missing	negative
Focused as it is on the relationship between Joseph and Suzy, the movie sheds little light on the February 13, 1976, assassination, which brought Olusegan Obasanjo to power.	negative
Utter rubbish! These are not serious people. Please, don't reward them with your Naira.	negative
this movie has to be the most depressing romantic comedy we have ever seen.	negative
Probably the worst acting ever in a movie which seems to be made with enough money.	negative
Way too slow. What a waste of time.	negative
I cant believe I spent 2 hours watching this movie	negative
i really don‚Äôt like this movie	negative
PLOT IS ALMOST EMPTY.	negative
Weak dialogue, amateurish battle scenes.	negative
From poor directing, to crap story; questionable acting to illogicality; shallow sceenwriting to bad editing..	negative
This movie is ugly.	negative
Asides from being terribly predictable and featuring generally below average acting, it is plagued by a be-fumbling series of subpar attempts at recreating worn out crime caper staples.	negative
I hate how this movie is titled.	negative
Bland and dreary, 'Efunsetan Aniwura' is an expos√© in gratuitously lazy and painfully appalling story-telling.	negative
I am livid	negative
THE LACK OF LANDSCAPE POSTERS FOR NOLLYWOOD FILMS	negative
ABSOLUTE RUBBISH	negative
this film promised so much but turned out to be gut wrenching ridiculous. Rubbish!!	negative
They seriously use smash bro‚Äôs title cards to introduce the characters...	negative
The movie seemed generally flat and draggy though out.	negative
It promised laughter, but the comedy was minimal and elicited smiles rather than the hearty laughter you expect when you go to the cinema for a comedy.	negative
Abigail isn't very good, the bad guy is a bit of a moustache twister, and they figured out that it sucks for black people to go back in time	negative
The lead female role a huge disappointment.	negative
The ending was the only enjoyable part of this for me. Good for her.	negative
"A travesty This is a disgrace and an awful disservice to CNA. Shame on this ""film""."	negative
A Trainwreck of a movie. 90s minutes of dissapointing Sound editing and acting.	negative
confused Was this what a good movie looked like in Africa in 2012? If so then ... it was great! I have to wonder (in that case) if it's gotten any better in 2021?.	negative
. Knock Out Blessing' is an utterly useless movie that ought not to have been made, or at least not released to the public. Rubbish!	negative
Unnecessarily long For me,	negative
for amateur actors that also had no direction from Akinropo. The sound was bad, probably from the lack of boom mics.	negative
Suga Suga has too many eye rolling scenes that eventually ended in an anticlimactic resolution of a weak conflict.	negative
Dishearteningly, Enitan's transition from lost soul to a scholar and now an artist gets shoved into the final minutes left over after all the bleakness.	negative
My first Nigerian movie  For the past several years, I have come across a number of reports telling about how the country of Nigeria has a successful domestic film industry. While that fact definitely intrigued me, I was unable to find any Nigerian movies available for me to look at until I stumbled upon this one on Netflix. To be honest, I was expecting something pretty crudely made, and to a large degree this is true. While there are some pretty good composed shots and/or direction that indicate that at times some real effort was being made by the filmmakers, the movie has far more shortcomings. The cinematography is unimpressive, there's very little in the way of production values, and the acting by many of the performers is amateurish. Actually, I might have been able to forgive all that had the movie's biggest problem did not exist, that being that it's far too long (121 minutes in length) and far too slowly paced. This is a story that really needed to be cut down either at the script stage or when the footage was being edited. There is a twist towards the end that's a little interesting (despite my ability to somewhat predict it before it unfolded), but it's too little and too late to make it worth sitting through a story that's too long and too slow. Still, if you have heard of Nigerian cinema and are curious about experiencing a sample of it, I've just told you of one possible accessible choice.	negative
Unfortunately, we can't bear cowboy pistols, space guns, cut & sow costumes, annoyingly talentless filming and unnecessary long form remembrance ceremonies for already shown footage all buttered up with ridiculously unintelligent revelations of supposed-to-be shockers that were apparent from the beginning.	negative
Unfortunately, the film is often stately and sluggish with some very daytime-soapy moments of emotional revelation.	negative
The movie wasn't great, a bit of overreaching of the actors (maybe over-directed?) but the context was great.	negative
Once Upon A Night' is a dud.	negative
As it is, you get no sense of place or character because too much has to be glossed over to fit it all in.	negative
This movie is too boring for cinema.	negative
bad	negative
We call it a kidnap- Held hostage for fifty odd minutes, we were forced on an excursion of the resort grounds, Not recommended.	negative
This lion didn't have much of a roar. Did someone send their failed Netflix pilot script to Nigeria like it was the losing Super Bowl team's t-shirt?	negative
Forceful story-telling and embarrassingly bad acting are the hallmarks of this shabby pretender - Might sound weird but; this flick is like a counterfeit of 'Isoken'.	negative
Dumb movie This movie is a joke.	negative
Diabolically bad! This is realistically the worst movie I've ever seen in my life!	negative
Action sequences weren't bad and its heart was in the right place, but quite painful to watch in places.	negative
Though the cinematography looks professional, don't let this film fool you. It's a disaster.	negative
No head, no tail, bad script, absolute waste of time and expensive rubbish. Movie was such a pain to watch. I highly do not recommend.	negative
their star quality is lacking in this movie	negative
lolz	negative
Verdict: Not recommended. 'Charmed' is not charming.	negative
So disapppointed. Some acting moments from main actors (king and Amina), but the supporting actor (Maladi), hard to tell if he is comic relief because his role should be serious.	negative
Rubbish! Not recommended for anybody. Not even children. Very irritating movie.	negative
Hands down one of the worst movies I‚Äôve ever seen	negative
Worst remake There was poor directing at the beginning during Ahannas flashbacks when he witnessed a man being set ablaze.	negative
Rubbish  One more piece of garbage from NETFLIX. Period !!	negative
Extremely flawed	negative
I skimmed this. no way i‚Äôm watching the whole thing	negative
you will regret wasting your time watching this movie	negative
Poor	negative
Excessively basic.	negative
The Millions' is essentially a shameless wholesale theft of 'Ocean's film series' scripts; we were not impressed.	negative
"Gbarada' is a typical Idumota ""Yoruba film"" with all the craziness that come with that sub-section of Nollywood."	negative
Holy one of Israel! What did Genevieve think she just did? A movie? This is corruption in the highest. The writers are quack.	negative
the worst movie production ever	negative
Just Crap	negative
Special Jollof' is yet another cold turkey from Nollywood in Diaspora. And as usual; it is highlighted by a y√©y√© story and a plethora of half hearted acting performances. There's nothing to see here. It's a total waste of money and time.	negative
I can confidently say that Luna taking a shit is a way more engaging story than chief daddy 2.	negative
i did not realise how many plane crashes there were in nigeria, and this film came out five days	negative
This Movie Would Have Done Better If Funded More ,	negative
With no modulating direction and no subtlety, this is a long, hard slog that will best be appreciated by friends and family of those in the cast and crew	negative
Not worth your time	negative
Utter rubbish It's very rare that I give up on a film, I couldn't finish this, gave up after 30mins. Don't waste your time.	negative
ultimately dampening the film overall for what could have been an even stronger, hard-hitting and poignant emotional roller coaster.	negative
Unfortunately lack of attention to detail didn't stop with the aforementioned examples.	negative
The Wait is full of stars, but it does not shine bright. It is like tasting a glass of wine that has not fully developed, perhaps, made with unripe grapes.	negative
This movie is so cheesy.	negative
this is an extremely boring and terrible film	negative
Hallmarked by nonsense, 'The Culprit' is complete and utter rubbish!	negative
Had to watch it for academic purposes.	negative
Way too slow. What a waste of time.	negative
Booorrring.	negative
That movie is such a bad egg to Nollywood.	negative
I caught the Nollywood bug while watching Rattlesnake.	negative
With all its ridiculous comical exaggerations and acting performances that fluctuate between over-acting and bad-acting.	negative
The production is all over the place, and most characters are not fully developed.	negative
waste of time and resources	negative
You will hate it	negative
Beautiful storyline BUT It was a waste of precious 2hrs	negative
Try as hard as they may; 'Your Excellency' proved extensively impotent, failing to deliver on its campaign promises.	negative
Absolute Garbage Not even worth being filmed. Actors are weak, script was written by a 12 year old. Poor sound quality.	negative
Taking a scenic, soap-opera route through the Nigerian civil war of the 1960s turns out to be a navigational error from which this lavishly appointed production can never fully recover.	negative
Continuity was not properly done for some of the scenes.	negative
The Final List' is a concoction of relentless hogwash.	negative
Completely whack and yet everything was so funny. Super entertaining, what else is there.	negative
I never feel sorry for the male leads in movies like this. Honestly, Team Sylvia. Dude was playing games.	negative
One of the things that may redeem an awful movie is costuming.	negative
Depressingly Boring and Pointless At the end, the movie fails in every way.	negative
"""The real Housewives of Lagos high society"" is wack"	negative
Awful The most stupid and dumb storyline in Nigerian movies history.	negative
Avoid this chunk of crap by all means necessary.	negative
Bland. Mechanical. Tactless. Frankly speaking.	negative
Lionheart does not really do or say anything new.	negative
Mofe ni Mofe' is a typical Yoruba movie made for African Magic Yoruba or even more appropriately; YouTube. It has no business in cinema.	negative
The movie tried to use suspense to depict some of the issues, but they were not properly executed.	negative
Appalling. A Nollywood soap opera plot that weirdly also foregrounds born-again Christianity	negative
Oldest skinheads in town  Absurd plot which pretends to be based on reality.	negative
Despite its laudable intentions and important social message, Black November is far too ineffective to have the desired impact.	negative
"Just as the saying goes: ""All that glitters is not Gold"", 'The Bling Lagosians' is not Gold."	negative
Lazy. Distasteful. Unimaginative. A dire mishap. And a record setter.	negative
Bridal Shower' has the singular honour of corralling the worst actresses in contemporary Nollywood in one movie.	negative
Oh geezzzzzz  What did I just watch for almost 30 mins? I tried and tried and tried to give it time but it was just awful! How did ANYONE think this movie was worth production??	negative
Menn! It was horrible joor!	negative
Worst ever movie- future cult classic?! Just dreadful, awful, trash....why on earth was this ever made?!	negative
Oh Dear! What a mess.But we've seen the whole fatal affair thing so many times and Deranged brings nothing new to the table.	negative
Debilitated by a weak story-line and even weaker story-telling, 'Mai'Muna' is a pedestrian 'drama that is not worth your time.	negative
W h a t  Messed up and kind of all over the place plot	negative
Good movie, way too long. Storytelling also needs pace.	negative
Highly flawed	negative
Wow how dissappointed Awful stick with This is England	negative
Purporting to tell historical heroic stories of sacrifice and resolve against oppressive colonialism, '1929' is so terrible.	negative
its lack of subtlety blunts the film's force.	negative
Absolutely not recommended. This is hogwash!	negative
I hate it	negative
With Nollywood's Shortcomings, Let's Dissect the Story	negative
I feel like these guys have an incredible passion for filmmaking. That's good. Keep improving.	negative
I'm sorry, I just didn't like it.  This film is a great example of some incredible archive footage ruined by a boring, mediocre and incoherent film in between.  Yes, I have read the book. I wasn't expecting a literal screen translation of the book, as the book covers a vast array of characters, but I did expect the essence of it to be retained.  It wasn't.  The film follows the lives of twin sisters Olanna (Thandie Newton) and Kainene (Akina Noni Rose) right after Nigeria gets its independence from the British and through to the Biafran war, as the Igbo people struggle to establish an independent republic. The film (similar to the book) tries to follow the lives of these 2 affluent young women, their relationships with men and with one another set against a significant historical event in Nigeria.  I went to watch this film specifically to support African Cinema and exited about a Nigerian Director making a film with a strong cast. I was bitterly disappointed with the lazy result.  Firstly the performances; Chiwetel Ejiofor is ever earnest in his role as Olanna's lover Odenigbo. He is OK, not offensive and gives a similar performance as he did in 12 years a slave. Thandie Newton is horrific. She has literally two expressions. I like to think its to do with the bad direction, someone should have told her she's over-acting .  The worst and best performance came from Odenigbo's Mother played by Onyeka Onwenu. What can I say. The best is that she was very entertaining, funny and a joy to watch. What made it the worst was that it belonged to a different film. A film I would have preferred to watch by the way. Her performance added a quality of a soap opera to the film. Anika had the strongest performance among them and deserves a mention for it.   The film has two parts, the first comes across as a cheap soap opera and the second, a cheap action movie. Choices that were made baffled me. Scenes played out that were pointless and didn't add much to the plot, making the first half plod along longer than it should have. The second half was riddled with inconsistencies and poor editing. Characters were introduced just as quickly as they were killed off. I am not sure why it was important to illustrate on a map were everyone was, that added nothing.  But the biggest problem with the film is that it lacked a director, a proper director. There wasn't anyone keeping the actors believable, controlling the movement of the camera, having a coherent edit or keeping tabs on the horrendous sound score.  Unbelievably the producers also produced Constant Gardener and should have known better than this. How can you allow an inexperienced Director to helm such a significant film? It's arrogant and irresponsible.  I am African (yes, I know it's a continent), I applaud any one trying to make our stories for an audience outside of the continent but this effort was so poor that I had to write about it. We can do much better than this.	negative
Absolutely Not Recommended. 'Detour' is completely asinine.	negative
Bad acting...	negative
The first major problem with this movie would have to be our lead actor. The other thing is actual performance.	negative
Sista Sista' is yet another colossal waste of money starring Enyimma Nwigwe, making it two crappy movies.	negative
A baseless movie	negative
However, in my opinion this is not Netflix worthy.	negative
Not recommended for intelligent minds.	negative
Transitions in the movie are haphazard and staccato.	negative
An ambitious film worthy of attention, regrettably it doesn't come together quite as powerfully as you'd hope.	negative
The Final List' is a concoction of relentless hogwash.	negative
The story is uninspired and adds nothing to the art genre it attempts to represent.	negative
This film is well intended and tries to go in depth on the issue, but sadly the filmmaking is so incompetent that it takes any emotional impact away.	negative
Not so here. 'Ajibade' is a typical Yoruba film with no real talent behind it	negative
Good sort, badly did	negative
I had hope for this in the begining, but it quickly faded away.	negative
This was bad in so many ways..	negative
Honestly, these people bamboozled us.	negative

Horrible! Oh my God! The ratings should even be a negative because I just couldn't believe the utter crap they produced!	negative
What a waste of time! Star studded casts with no story to tell. Zero sense of direction nor any reasonable theme....too much distraction from the family theme of part one....üôÑ	negative
It is not recommended because; despite what is admittedly very crispy production, ultimately characters obviously acting retarded through a series of nonsensical scenarios.	negative
Unfortunately it turned out to be a rain of illogicalities buffeted by amateurish acting	negative
Interesting premise, terrible script	negative
This movie deserves the award for the 1st disaster recorded in 2022. To those not familiar with Nollywood, this movie is not acceptable while those familiar with Nollywood understands this was terrible.	negative

Slow-moving Nigerian drama about sexual harassment, assault	negative
There is very little about this movie that makes sense.	negative
The cinematography in the movie was basic and was not too exciting.	negative

Maybe the best thing about this is that it's at least entertaining enough that you won't tear your hair out if you happen to see it	negative
The story is so convoluted and so unnecessarily dragged out that.	negative
Very disappointing adaptation of great novel Half of a Yellow Sun	negative
The movie is terrible to say the least, despite the top notch actors.	negative

What we got was a tacky ending with unrealistic dialogue.	negative
The music and audio effects did not always match the seriousness of some of the movie scenes.	negative

This movie is a no from me	negative
bad acting, stiff dialogue, and an overuse of a melodramatic soundtrack	negative
Poorly subtitled  The language being spoken is Igbo but it is being labelled as Hausa.	negative

Terrible Movie... worst Nigerian movie I've seen	negative
Extremely Boring!	negative
new drinking game: take a shot every time you see characters wearing atrocious wigs.	negative

A waste of money. This movie is completely useless. It is crappy, dull and uninspiring.	negative
The movie was well done but I could not figure out what type of movie it wanted to be and what was the story about until I stopped watching somewhere at the middle.	negative
Despite strong performances and plenty of incident, writer and director Biyi Bandele fails to establish the narrative's wider national and political context, and the film is ultimately insubstantial as a result.	negative
Boring and weak plot.	negative
Good sort, badly did I was unimpressed due to the production of this both in terms of acting and script	negative
Possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen.	negative
their comedic antics have become too stale, too repetitive and too predictable to be worth recommending this sham of a movie.	negative
Profoundly irritating and annoying.	negative
It's your typical Nollywood movie, cheating, ancestral folklore, bad acting	negative
Then worst of all is the story; as simplistic as a Yoruba film story could ever be it lacks, intrigue, suspense or any telltale signs of intellectual manipulation.	negative
A grimly interesting story that is sadly reduced to a cliched, tedious movie.	negative
It‚Äôs odd that an autobiographical passion project feels so limp, hackneyed, and labored	negative
We can do better than this trashy movie	negative
For a supernatural thriller cum action movie, Nneka the Pretty Serpent took too long to make it‚Äôs point.	negative
What the hell is going on here The movie is so bad at some point you wonder whether you're watching a comedy or a drama movie.	negative
The movie has the most ridiculous robbery scene ever in the movie universe, and it is way too long.	negative
Poor visuals	negative
The worst part is that; for some uncanny reason, the producers chose to belabor their poor audience with unwieldy subtitles that disappear very quickly.	negative
Again, producer missed the point The movie has no destination, no solid plot, just run offs	negative
The Road to Yesterday is not, probably, the stupidest picture we ever saw, but it is, nevertheless, very, very dull, and well-nigh unintelligible as well.	negative
Suru l' ere' is crappy.	negative
An ecample of a character who does not fit the role in this movie is Tope Tedela. In his role as a semi-literate mai-suya, he is too refined and too well spoken. 	negative
not recommended	negative
This movie is bullshit	negative
As a comedy it starts out well enough but soon gets a little (but not much) more drama-like with its storyline to the detriment of the film. Has a very inner-city urban styling.	negative
I am angry I watched this movie	negative
This is a soulless muddled mess that does great disservice to a great book.	negative
As ridiculous and as unimaginative as its title is, very little separates 'Makate Must Sell' from Papa Ajasco's 'Knock Out'.	negative
This one star is for Oc Ukeje	negative
Good history, poor quality.	negative
Its characters (especially Sades) are messy and have many poorly executed emotions and phases of grief or happiness.	negative
Made for tv melodrama It was so cheesy at certain parts that it was hard to continue watching. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	negative
you do not deserve to watch this horrible subpar movie	negative
MESSED UP MOVIE No lesson learnt. Please we don't want part2.	negative
Horribly Booring  Wasted 2h20min of my life watching this baseless, senseless movie.  Its seriously bad!!!!	negative
Terribly made and stupidly written. This reeks of the Hallmark Channel.	negative
Not bad, not good, just unmemorable.	negative
Slow moving predictability	negative
Had potential, but fails to draw you in	negative
It could've been way better.	negative
save yourself from this distateful movie	negative
Such a shame with 'Fantastic Numbers'; going by its sophisticated posters alone	negative
Poor	negative
Slow The acting is ok, but the script is quite poor.	negative
Limitlessly not recommended. Work hard to avoid this rubbish forever; even on TV.	negative
When we thought it was all over, the concluding scene brought even more confusion.	negative
Terrible and amateur attempt at a film  Seems like someone's school project more than a real film . Terrible acting and production value .	negative
Scenes were muddled up	negative
This is four movies in one loosely bound by coke product placement	negative
Utterly not recommended. 'My London Slave' is complete hogwash. A total waste of money. There's no way you go in to see this and come out happy. Because, everything about this sham of a movie is calculated to irritate you. And it will. Please, don't pay for misery.	negative
Real life vs. badly executed bad acting, especially from the villains in this movie.	negative
The sketchy storyline is overly reliant on clich, caricature and contrivance.	negative
Alakada Reloaded' is a sham.	negative
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE	negative
This is indeed a very stupid movie.	negative
I don't know man, this movie sucks and my legs hurt.	negative
Absolutely Not Recommended.	negative
The first notable flaw is the film‚Äôs length	negative
Well, when the main positive thing that people list about the film is the colour grading, you probably know you‚Äôre not going to experience an amazing story.	negative
Ultimately, it lacks any real story and as far as production is concerned.	negative
A good story ruined by a bad screenplay	negative
A powerful novel has been neutered.	negative
Would‚Äôve loved this if it starred Princess Vitarah.	negative
Such a shame!	negative
Only in broad Nollywood comedy mode does it feel truly convincing.	negative
Unoriginal and boring movie	negative
mean-spirited, unfunny, kinda classist.	negative
this movie is terribly boring. Very dull.Very draggy.	negative
It is a neccesity to remove this movie from being accessible to the media as it depicts and reinforces the great issues in today's modern society relating to racism.	negative
The Ghost and the Tout' is unrepentantly immoderate in everything.	negative
it is a good for nothing film that shouldn't have been made.	negative
what the hell is this that I watched	negative
Amateurish Production Started to watch this but it was so disjointed, jumping all over the place that I stopped after 20 minutes.	negative
Bitterly disappointing	negative
It is so very tonally deaf to what is going on	negative
Absolute Trash. 1985 Bollywood called, they want their script back.	negative
Lopsided. Low quality. Lackluster. And ludicrous.	negative
It was perhaps too close to the subject to tell it with the clarity it demands.	negative
The acting was great but the plot was quite weak.	negative
Watching this movie made me dull	negative
Dreadful I am baffled that Netflix would subject its audience to this kind of low budget rubbish.	negative
Has the look and feel of a soap opera from 1985 except with fewer twists, less campiness, no surprises, less suspense and a very long, drawn out plot.	negative
Social Media 101' is lazily unoriginal. This is the handiwork of an ideas pirate; someone who plagiarizes the creative ideas of others, makes them his own and seeks to profit from same. Plagiarism! That is the stuff 'Social Media 101' is made of. The producers put not an iota of creativity into making this a movie.	negative
The historical context is more intriguing than the specifics of this harrowing and provocative story, which lacks sufficient character depthand narrative texture.	negative
Waste of time Something to interest me or hook me...nothing what a Snoozefest!!	negative
DULL STORYLINE One of the worst Nigerian movies I have watched in a while.	negative
Awkward to watch	negative
almost felt like 2 different movies. The story needed tighter translation of the events happening.	negative
Opportunity lost	negative
NOT A MOVIE	negative
Psychological Horror, Nollywood Style!!! meddlecore14 October 2017	negative
So this was long and boring	negative
the chances of Nollywood making a great film is pretty slim.	negative
The need to be extraneously goofy and ridiculous in Nollywood cinema is getting annoying	negative
Can't say this movie makes sense	negative
Really awkward.	negative
so bad	negative
And underlining all that is a thick sludge of brazenly obvious & forceful comedy.	negative
.Although the tension is not too high, suspense is not a thing, the obstacle could have taken more sweat and sacrifices, but yet, Lionheart is really good.	negative
Another waste of time More Netflix boring crap, I'm glad it's free so i don't pay for these terrible selection.	negative
Ultimately, murdered by severe cases of over-acting and wanton fake-ness, 'Hire a Woman' is a sterile movie that lacks any real magic.	negative
Soap opera This is a bad soap opera pretending to be an air flight disaster thriller.	negative
Clustered Colours' is like cheap doughnut with plenty of nothing around a very tiny something.	negative
What happened to attention to detail	negative
This movie based on the ebola outbreak in Nigeria was very depressing and it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. In fact, it wasn't what I was expecting either.	negative
You should not watch this movie	negative
Production and soundtrack ruined a good story	negative
"Painfully slow and pedestrian horror soap opera whose only novelty is ""It's from Nigeria!"""	negative
And yet another forceful comedy. Nollywood just doesn't get it.	negative
Clustered Colours' is like cheap doughnut with plenty of nothing around a very tiny something	negative
Did not watch all of this crap. Not even second rate, obviously racially inclined crap from an African nation.	negative
There was nothing good about this movie	negative
The storyline is shoddy and has misplaced and unfunny jokes.	negative
This movie at best had mediocre acting, and tried to promote forgiveness for a highly abusive husband, rapist, and a pedophile of his adopted daughter.	negative
Hence, this wreck of a movie plays like a relic straight out of the nineties. A complete waste of money.	negative
Now, causing cinema patrons to sleep off their premiums isn't necessarily a crime in all cases.	negative
there's an unmeasurable deluge of nonsensical characteristics dogging this 'Good' movie.	negative
Good message, poorly executed	negative
some of the drama felt artificial made just to make two characters have some conflict, the characters were fine some were annoying	negative
A Hollywood Deception	negative
Good story spoiled by amateurs	negative
chief Daddy 2 is an unfocused mess, which would be tolerable if it only made us laugh more often.	negative
OMG Cringe  What the actual F. The dialogue, the acting, the soundtrack	negative
"Painfully slow and pedestrian horror soap opera whose only novelty is ""It's from Nigeria!"""	negative
A sore disappointment. It is excruciating to sit through. Sob!	negative
A case of laudable ambition collapsed into episodic box-ticking.	negative
