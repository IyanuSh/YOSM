so cool. . . . This was so chilled. this movie was fun and enjoyable from the start. I've found no flaws to it, maybe the introduction is a little corny, but thats just taste. this movie was light but meaningful. highly recommended!	positive
KOB is Number 1 Nollywood movie to me right now. The story is way different and genuine. Unveils what goes on in politics for real.	positive
This was an excellent movie. I would recommend it to anyone!	positive
Love this Film. . I will enjoy watching it for many years to come and the conversations that it will spark. . . The acting is very natural without melodrama and it feels very believable. Overall, the film was riveting and kept me really engaged.	positive
Love this Film	positive
A BRILLIANT MOVIE WITH A FEW PECKS	positive
Beautiful story that portrays Nigerian culture. The story is so unique and unpredictable unlike an average Nigerian movie. A must watch	positive
A must see, very interesting story and well acted, great collaboration with Hollywood and Nollywood actors. I thoroughly enjoyed it.	positive
Fresh POV. . It is not the kind of cinema we are used to in the western hemisphere, but the production highlights not only a story to develop, but also the colors and culture of the region in which it takes place.	positive
"""Citation"" works best when it hovers in the infuriating skepticism hurled at its young protagonist as she makes her case, and it's unclear whether the system will work in her favor until the final, unnerving act."	positive
In a movie which seems like it should have been a mini-series, we follow a relationship, which grows into a family, over the course of 20 years in Nigeria.	positive
Finally, a good one. . . . A solid entry from the stables of Ayo Makun that combines genuine comedy with love at heart. A must watch for all Nigerians.	positive
The best Nigerian movie I've ever seen. . This movie is amazing! Very creative and not predictable. I love how the story line is current and relates to what is going on in Nigeria at the moment. The acting was great - Sola Sobowale is a legend!	positive
It's a superb piece of work: fresh, harrowing and very humane	positive
Good series. . I'm really impressed with this series. Its captivating and entertaining.	positive
I love this movie. . . . This movies is a very good movies and I wish it will still continue and please when is the season three and four going to be released .	positive
This is the reality of being a fault first child in affluent African homes.. . This movie is the reality of the struggle of being female in a male dominated and controlled African environment.	positive
Wonderful story. . . . The movie has a lot of moral lessons. Great role interpretation by Zainab Balogun. If you have lost your way, this movie all you need to re-direct your path to God.	positive
A provocative if slightly plodding movie‚Ä¶	positive
Technically, the sound is very good, and camera angles and techniques are unusual and interesting. The fight scenes are well choreographed.	positive
Best Nigerian movie seen in a long while. . Amazing movie that really l captures Nigerian culture and its movie industry	positive
What a disturbing but engaging story. . . . This is a really disturbing story. I feel so sad for Enitan, I cannot possibly imagine what he went through in his childhood. His transformation is remarkable. In the final ending it reveals who Enitan is, and I'm shocked by the revelation. It brings the film to another level of emotional climax.	positive
Incredible movie, great rendention and good story line.	positive
Romper Stomper with a twist and also a masterpiece drama. . . . Best Skinhead Cultural movie done in years...if you like movies like Romper Stomper, This is England, A Clockwork Orange...you will probably like this and if you like well made dramas also.... actors first movie produce and from peronal experience too....exellent work mate....loved it...so sad that people down grade this masterpiece in art form from a personal view, from a rookie of making movies... enjoy folks....	positive
Really great for women (and men too). . In a world where women are pressured to look better than they are, and live above their means, this show serves as a great tool of financial education to guide them into sensible organisation of their finances and the benefits of delayed gratification. Oh, and it's entertaining too! Fantastic acting!. . . . I don't know what's with the music production though, seems like the same songs were on repeat in every episode.	positive
The use of proverbs, innuendos, and play on words, provides so many memorable one liners and quotes that will remain on our tongues for a long time. We will quote the lines and recall the pleasure of watching this series.	positive
Good for a first.. . A fairly straightforward plot that delivers nothing new, save being the first Nigerian Christmas themed movie. The casting was sweet.	positive
A very good movie with a good lesson!. . . . This is movie is about a coming of age comedy/drama about a young boy who wants to fix things with his hands rather sit behind a cubicle. In a broader sense, I think this is just celebrating how things are done in Africa, and how kids learn to be humble.	positive
Citation delivers on giving us a logical representation of what happens in the real world to a large percentage of the youth, particularly students, and more particularly those of the female gender.	positive
Crazy,Lovely,Cool. . . . My favorite Nigerian actress Adesua Etomi-wellington brought me to this tv series and I was not disappointed, it was a pleasant surprise to see good acting, really good writing on top of seeing her, all main characters had substance and were not over the top clich√© characters, each episode could stand on it's own with plot twists and reveals, if anybody is looking for a good binge watch you couldn't go wrong with this Nigerian gem	positive
It‚Äôs a pity, because this could have been very interesting. But as it is, it's just total amateur hour.	positive
Was glued!!!!. . . . I enjoyed it. It was brilliant coming from the stables of Hollywood movies. Not a wasted time spent	positive
Phenomenal!! Proud of this Nollywood Production!!	positive
An Amazing Movie. . . . A beautiful story, well told & portrayed. Everything from the locations to makeup, cast, costume, even language & and the showcase of culture was simply breathtaking. Well done Kunle Afolayan	positive
Super Recommended! 'Gold Statue' is Magnificent Excellence. It promises a mountain of fun. And with that mountain, comes rivers of quality and an avalanche of Perfect acting performances. This movie is worth every penny you will spend and more.	positive
Hands down the best Nigerian movie I have ever seen..	positive
Good but Kinda Cheesy. . I liked this murder mystery from Nigeria. . . The plot was thick and readable part way in but far enough in to keep my interest.	positive
IntereÃÅsting. . . . This movie was intereÃÅsting from start to finsh. The acting was world class.	positive
What it means to be Nigerian.. . . . Well done Genevieve Nnaji: a movie for all to see. Kudos Naija, keep improving.	positive
Only one problem	positive
Lionheart is a solid film that effectively portrays sexism in workplace in Nigeria. It is very straightforward, highly predictable and also quite weakly directed by Genevieve Nnaji. But on the opposite side of things, her acting performance is terrific, and she successfully elevated both the character and the overall material. The movie is clich√©d, but charming. It would have been a perfect potential nominee for the Academy had they not stupidly eliminated it due to it being filmed in the English language.	positive
Mind blowing!!!!. . . . This is one of the best movies I have ever watched! I LOVE it!!!!!	positive
A wonderful film experience! Substantial storyline.. . The suspense would keep you on your toes, and the comic relief would make you chuckle. It is definitely worthwhile.	positive
A good sequel but a remake would have been far better for good story buildup. . . . I must say I commend the director and his acting too ( Ramsey Nouah).	positive
100% on point. So accurate n so well played. Everyone was fantastic. Makes one proud ure Nigerian üëèüëçüòò	positive
It is beautiful to see Sam Dede on our screens again, and to see he is still a master of his craft, giving us a stellar performance. Where there is Stella Damasus, you can be sure to see some genuine tears, with emotional scenes, and she seems ageless.	positive
Perfection. . . . This is a must watch movie!. I can't even say more. I'm short of words.	positive
Interesting how open the characters are to speaking about their relationships and with restraining anger during such emotional circumstances.	positive
It was pretty interesting to actually find out how the hymn Amazing Grace was actually written.	positive
This movie really touched my heart in regards to God's AMAZING GRACE! A MUST SEE!!!	positive
AMAZING!. . . . Stella acting, stella production, stella directing.. . . . The movie was an experience. I was on the edge of my sit for 7 hours binge watching the whole series.	positive
It is globally minded filmmaking that is also comfortingly familiar.	positive
A great children movie. . . . I think the Mirror Boy is a great children movie, simple in spirit, yet powerful, effective and well performed. The soundtrack is awesome, varied and rich, quite appealing and also bridging tradition and contemporary concepts	positive
Seeing Richard Mofe-Damijo (RMD) as Ejiro, a retired thug for hire and crime lord, is a complete departure from his usual role of the wealthy father, he kills it.	positive
On the 1st of August, a graduation party brings more than anyone expected.. . . . The film is a suburban drama that examines how a family manages to survive its past, and how that past is inextricably entwined with their future. . . . . During a graduation party, the estranged father, Dipo, returns. Each family member deals with his return differently, and thus we see how they must have survived his initial departure. As we learn the reasons for his departure and the reasons for his return, our sympathies shift.. . . . The film is well acted and the story unfolds itself smoothly and naturally, without resorting to exposition. It is refreshing to see a dramatic film about African Americans that veers from stereotypes.	positive
Adorable.... . . . A very good plot, a mix of suspense and superstition, predictable until the end, with a good plot twist, good performances, in love with the works of Kunle Afolayan, who always acts in his films, in which he directs, writes and produces, multifunctional ... Adorable...	positive
Doctor Lanre' is an Interesting Shift. . . . I am glad to be one of the first on the train of this movie. This is an interesting shift. The story has a rich plot that is carried effortlessly by the superb performances of the cast. . . This is a must-see.	positive
As Adenike, Gurira is wonderful: Her face is equally radiant whether she's channeling anguish or joy, and she captures the ways in which this woman, so old-country dutiful, also longs to join the modern world.	positive
Best of the best	positive
Good movie.... . . . Excellent film, in a dystopian future in Nigeria, with all its ailments, a hope in honesty and manliness, turn to chaos, very good, female characters in addition to beautiful strong and determined, unscrupulous taking advantage of despair and helplessness, good tension scenes , good movie..	positive
Nice award movie. . . . Nice award movie and the actress are amazing lovely and very outstanding movi	positive
Great Tale. . . . This is a premium movie anytime. Tells the tales of our society decay. So sad! So true!	positive
Made me interested in learning more about Nigerian history. Any movie that makes me want to learn more gets at least 4 stars in my book.	positive
Breathtakingly nice movie!. . . . At first I was a bit skeptical, as I wasn't exposed to Nigerian cinema before. However, by the end of the movie (brilliantly done by the way), I realised that I witnessed an audio-visual masterpiece. Highly recommend!	positive
A feel-good movie with the right cultural mix. A lot to be learnt from a super woman who fights hard to keep her place in a male dominated world. Warm and awesome movie!	positive
It was Fantastic!! Ignore the negative reviews. . . . Honestly. It was mindblowing! Didn't even believe it was shot in Nigeria, the production was special and the cast were A1. They all played thier parts well and made it fun!	positive
An intimate study of challenges of motherhood	positive
Something new. . . . Despite seeing its low rating - I think, Namaste Wahala definitely deserves a 1 time watch for being something new and different.	positive
Nice movie!!!!. . . . I love the story line, I love the act and I love the fact that its a story about what is really happening in our society	positive
Farming makes for a harrowing watch, but Idris is a star in the making, and Beckinsale is terrific as a Tilbury mommie dearest.	positive
fun movie	positive
Give the movie some credit. . I think it was very interesting and had some brutal violence but I find it necessary to tell the story.	positive
Very funny movie. . . . This movie is very funny.I literally laughed from the begining to the end.	positive
A Good One. . Hmmm... This was a movie. A GOOD ONE and that's about it.	positive
"Running for only a paltry sixty six minutes, 'The Delivery Boy' is the quintessential definition of ""Quality over Quantity"". This movie is one of the best movies we have seen come out of ""Young"" Nollywood. The makers had the good sense to match technical quality with a good story that is simple, yet very engaging and avoids being overly predictable like its lazy counterparts ""Young"" Nollywood is wont to churn out.. . . . We had fun seeing this today, and so did the miniscule audience we were blessed to see it with. We all left the hall with zero regrets. And we are sure you will too. While 'The Delivery Boy' is far from being perfec, we can confidently tell you that; if there ever was a Nollywood movie that deserved your support by paying to see it, 'The Delivery Boy' is the one. It is incredibly bold and progressive. Applaudable material. Go for it!"	positive
Movie is everything!	positive
Broke the mould. . . . I've watched a lot of Nigerian films. The quality can vary in terms of storyline, cinematography, actual acting, sound quality. This film broke the mould in all those respects.	positive
A coming of age dramedy that loses its way in the mean streets of modern Africa.	positive
Nigerian Prince pulls you in, charms you, and tells you a complex and powerful story without losing itself. The film draws no clear moral conclusions, no clear solution as to what, or who, is right or wrong.	positive
Slowly blossoming into something beautiful. This film is about two childhood friends who fight against the odds to be together.	positive
A Noble Directorial Debut. . . . I discovered this on Tubi and I enjoyed it. It has its flaws but it doesn't take away from how great the film is. . . . It's a great movie	positive
Art Immitating Life...or is it?	positive
Overall, it was entertaining but like most Nollywood films, there were no added layers of complexity; the good and bad guys are always too easily identifiable and thusly one dimensional.	positive
This movie really need more credits as it's brilliant documentary-style filmmaking. Never saw any pandemic movie like this, a fresh perspective.	positive
I love this movie, but I can't understand who died and who didn't. It is a horror movie, but I am a 7 year old and I'm okay. I would rate it 6+.	positive
It's a feel-good movie, and a true story apparently.	positive
decent. Acting and story were good, but production/execution could have been a bit better. overall ok.	positive
A powerful movie that will move your heart.	positive
Pretty uneventfull. Good movie - British politics....ha.	positive
some scenes in this movie are really touching. watch it	positive
Superb Sound Effects. . . . The movie is really good. The actors were brilliant. The ending was questionable but the sound effects were the best I've heard in any Nigerian movie till date.	positive
Nice movie but for 18+. . . . Nice movie for 18+ . I enjoyed every bit of the movie.	positive
Interesting and enlightening movie‚Å∑. . . . The movie seems to pass messages connected to different aspects of the society. Virtually every moment was captivating.	positive
An Interesting Bold Move. . . . I did definitely enjoy this moive for sure... especially being one who isn't particularly big on Nigerian (or do I still say Nollywood?) movies	positive
Pleasantly surprised	positive
A huge step in Nigeria's Movie Industry. . . . The cast were good. All portrayed their roles well enough, it was almost seamless. This says a lot for most Nigerian movies	positive
Cinematography was crystal. Star-studded, the acting was top-notch and touched on issues bedevilling Nigeria as a nation.	positive
So relatable for Africans in the diaspora. . . . Spoke to my own experience if being a African not living in Africa and trying so  to find belonging in a new home. Fantastic film!	positive
Shows corruption in its splendor	positive
This film is is a true story and is aposlutely brilliant and moving.	positive
However, this failed to be anything other than boring. It had no logical flow	negative
Very bad acting, but the movie is still entertaining.	negative
This was a No, No! Really bad performances from the main cast.	negative
Entertaining despite being flawed	negative
This movie feels like a mish mash of under-developed ideas with a half hearted romance thrown in.	negative
The movie script cannot pass for a high school amateur production.	negative
I dislike this movie so much	negative
The acting was SO bad and the  writing was even worse.	negative
The acting is at best wooden, the dialogue almost staccato, as if the actors are constantly being prompted with their lines.	negative
Everything about this movie speaks low budget	negative
Dig to stole your time!	negative
What a Mess	negative
Only in broad Nollywood comedy mode does it feel truly convincing.	negative
Charmed' is not charming. No how!	negative
Horrible. . The show lingers on and on seeming to go no where at times.	negative
The fact that it's a musical makes it absolutely TERRIBLE.	negative
Utter fiction. The acting is awful and the story unbelievable.	negative
LMAO	negative
A sore disappointment, 'Levi' is drama without purpose.	negative
"The film is remarkable for its lack of self-pity, but it makes the experience of ""Farming"" a merciless one for the audience too."	negative
I am convinced it would have fared better as a 10 to 30 minute short movie to test the waters.	negative
drama without purpose.	negative
Well intentioned but amateurish attempt to move the viewer.	negative
Imagine trying to make indomie without spice. . This movie is soo bad that 5 minutes to the end you're still wondering what's going o.	negative
The screenplay is ridiculous	negative
They just sewed together different jokes, memes and videos of little known comics that have gone viral on Nigerian social media, called it their own movie and brought it to cinema. If you are Big on social media, you will have seen many of them, many times before. And you are not likely to find them to be very funny here as the producers even fail to excel at plagiarism, leaving 'Social Media 101' plagued by bottom of the barrel acting, very boring dialogue and particularly horrible scene lighting. This is all round ridiculous!	negative
"This movie is ugly. ""Ugly"" must be the word."	negative
Another Nigerian Movie With Lot of Hype but Very Empty.. . I won't recommend this to anyone.	negative
It's not really that bad - but the script and directing suffers overall.	negative
The movie‚Äôs opening is jarring. There is no backstory for Laila‚Äôs appearance	negative
Very poor story telling... and a massive rewrite of history for the sake of the movies plot.	negative
Retarded. Gratuitous. And senseless.	negative
Not a great movie	negative
This movie was an eyesore	negative
it tells a piecemeal story one could swear was hurriedly written by a primary school pupil for last year's Cultural Day drama presentation	negative
If you value your time, work hard to dodge this at a premium.	negative
Can a movie be bad, but important?	negative
If I were a film prof trying to get away with torturing my students, I truly cannot think of a better fit for a required screening.	negative
Too long, bad acting, too much irrelevance	negative
. Forceful story-telling and embarrassingly bad acting are the hallmarks of this shabby pretender.	negative
How does a movie with this subject matter wind up being this slow and boring?	negative
this is a story that has the potential for critical acclaim, but the execution is poor and makes it easily forgettable.	negative
This movie has less charisma than the 'Third Eye' series from the nineties with Pa Olu Jacobs. Stay away from this.	negative
nollywood keeps disgracing us	negative
Survival of Jelili' is a pageantry of the absurd and a flagrant eyesore.	negative
At the conclusion of the original Chief Daddy movie, the introduction of a new character in the last scene hinted at a sequel, but Chief Daddy 2 takes the sophomore curse to a new level of low.	negative
Wasn't supposed to end there.. unprofessional screenwriter	negative
The plot was totally unrealistic and it was all over the place.	negative
A colossal waste of time and money	negative
this movie is so lame, even children will not like it.	negative
Absolutely horrendous. . Storyline is absolutely the worst, could not bring myself to watch till the end..	negative
Most times, not enough effort is put into storytelling. This movie is ridiculous!	negative
If somehow, If you know anyone deserving of your punishment, just buy them a ticket.	negative
One of the worst. . . . With the hype I would expect a great movie but this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.	negative
I was kind of digging it at first but the movie has pacing issues, needs to be edited, and is way too long.	negative
Does anyone else agree the lead looks like a cross between Anthony Mackie and Daniel Kaluuya?	negative
an absurd movie	negative
The Call' is awesomely retarded.	negative
Everything seems off-target, minor, as though the story (which is at times unforgivably unclear) isn't being dramatised so much as merely acted out and hurried through.	negative
Not recommended for anybody. Not even children. Very irritating movie, 'Another Father's Day' will leave you with a migraine. With terrible acting and an outstandingly imbecilic story-line, this ridiculous low grade Disney wannabe excuse of a comedy will make anyone and everyone lose interest in Nollywood forever. Such a sham. And a terrible waste, this is what comes of writing stories and producing movies with the sole intention of advertising an amusement park, but people shouldn't have to pay to watch long-form adverts. We strongly suggest you stay far away from this filth if you value your time and energy.	negative
29 out of 100	negative
Missed opportunity	negative
Complete waste of 2hours. . Not what I expected, and the movie is filled with utter annoying and dry humour.	negative
The story didn't really do much for me and became extremely predictable and repetitive by the end	negative
Waste of time. . Wasn't really a clear plot, didn't make sence and just having a Nigerian man cussing a Jamaican cuss word is not Jamaica??	negative
Not by the film's good use of humour, performances, fights and chases, but by how bad it is, and then you wonder	negative
A rom-com where...the kitchen, hotel and country we see here don't feel cooked in, lived in or loved in.	negative
I would like to be... a terrorist . . Funniest shit watched in a long time	negative
Not fantastic. It's entertaining. Not spectacular.	negative
Not Recommended. Intriguing story unfortunately told by insufficient talent.	negative
I wanted to like this movie. . But I just couldn't. Slow -moving but still predictable. Too bad.	negative
Sorry, very poor in all aspects. . What a terrible waste of almost 2hrs of my life.	negative
Midnight Crew' is yet another repulsively ugly Nollywood comedy to avoid at the cinemas.	negative
Another good potential ruined by bad writing.	negative
Papa Ajasco comes to cinema in this exceptionally ridiculous and ostentatiously foolish comedy.	negative
I really wanted to like this film. I liked most of the actors and the production quality was good, but even though it was only 1 hr 34 it seemed to drag on forever. I had to stop and start this movie a few times. I finally finished it after a couple of months.	negative
I hate that iwasted my time watching this movie	negative
Sadly there's too much soundtrack used throughout the film and it has the effect of making the movie feel thirty-year old.	negative
Does not live up to Production Value	negative
complete rubbish	negative
it was so bad that it totaly lost the tone of the first scene, that wasn't that good but has so much more to offer.	negative
Bad movie	negative
Good until the end. . Horrible mistake!	negative
expected much more	negative
At approximately two hours long, the far majority of 'God Calling' is unexciting, bland and dreary.	negative
Wasted potential. . I left the theater in disgusted disappointment.	negative
This is the worst film I have ever seen.	negative
Weak dialogue, amateurish battle scenes.	negative
Fine Wine could have been more exciting, but the potential of the story was not fully explored and it was further marred by a very sluggish pace.	negative
Absolutely Not Recommended.	negative
Overhyped Uninteresting Movie. . . The character development is quite poor as viewers may be irritated with some.	negative
Despite being produced by Zeb Ejiro and directed by Chico Ejiro, two Nollywood Goliaths, this 'Night Bus to Lagos' fails to arrive safely. the nineties. A complete waste of mone.	negative
not recommended. With zero originality and even less authenticity.	negative
very bad movie	negative
Fresh. Bold. Salacious. Illogical. Dissatisfying.	negative
One-way traffic plot, average movie at best.. . . . Lionheart was a movie that generated a lot of buzz in the Nollywood industry. Considering the international support it got from Netflix, I was particularly excited to see how this movie went.. . . . From the get go the movie wears an indigenous look with local scenery and an instant banter in local language.. . . . However, it was one way traffic from there onwards, as the movie progressed.. . . . The plot is totally bare and overly predictable, and I'm still reeling from the shock of this being a comedy film.. . . . However, I still applaud the production quality of this film as it was great and a large chunk of the headline cast delivered on their script-save for Peter Okoye who was highly disappointing.. . . . For a directorial debut, one can only applaud the courage of Genevieve in pulling off this movie.. . . . On a final note, you are not guaranteed to have a good time watching this, and do not expect any fireworks.	negative
i have a thing against films with the characters and setting being foreign	negative
a movie with high rated actors but it was poorly executed	negative
Not Recommended. 'Dejavu' is a typical Yoruba film.	negative
Not Recommended for cinema. This movie is stressful.	negative
